S

Speaker 1 01:26
Anything that requires digital marketing. So we don't really cap the type of client, but we do
kind of have a price point that kind of usually will put the client in a specific place when they
when we talk with

S

Speaker 2 01:40
them, Okay, got you, how do you position yourself? Like, do you guys? Like, are you considered
a growth agency, a marketing agency,

S

Speaker 1 01:51

that's why we are able to touch on all levels. So we're able to touch on video, we're able to
touch on web, we're able to touch on digital marketing. We're able to touch on marketing in
general, you know, real world strategies, techniques, anything that the client is

S

Speaker 2 02:14
going to require. Okay, amazing. Wow. Sounds like you guys do really, really incredible work.

02:20
And you mentioned, like, you guys have a high price point.

S

Speaker 2 02:25
What's your business model like? Do you like charge based on like success, success, or is it flat
rate? Or how does that work?

S

Speaker 1 02:35
Yes, we have a spend rate, monthly rate, based on what the client is requiring. So we will figure
out where they are in their phase of their business, and we will curate

02:50
their strategy around that.

S

Speaker 2 02:51
Okay, wow, basically, I don't think I've ever heard that before. Okay, um, okay, so what do you
like currently use for your clients? Like, what kind of platforms I'm guessing you use, like,
LinkedIn, Facebook, meta, like Google? What do you guys use

03:10
to advertise our clients? Yeah,

S

Speaker 2 03:13

S

Speaker 2 03:13
for advertising, I'm specifically talking about like, yeah, advertising,

S

Speaker 1 03:17
gotcha. Yeah, any platform all actually, you know, we, we basically use whatever gives us the
best return. So we'll run small ads, and then we'll scale. So if we're running ads, you know, a lot
of times was just, we need to do boost on the ground marketing, and we need to, you know, do
do customer relationships and, you know, community building and stuff like that. So it'll
depend. And, you know, sometimes we can get away with local, sometimes we need national.
So we are able to basically, like, I said, configure everything for the client specifically,

03:54
okay, so it's customized to each client,

S

Speaker 1 03:59
correct, depending on where they're at. So like, like, you say it's a business, we'll go to
LinkedIn, if it is a e com. Instagram does well, we do a lot of influencer marketing with, you
know, partner, partnering influencers, and basically, you know, doing social media reels and
content around that, and then, you know, repurposing them for ads or strategies around that, it
really depends,

S

Speaker 2 04:28
makes complete sense. And are you more of like a brand? Like you kind of mentioned, like,
whatever brings results. But how do you kind of measure success? Like, what are the goals that
you can actually, what can you promise your clients?

S

Speaker 1 04:45
Yeah, so we we promised them. When we onboard them, we, you know, when we first talk to
them, we understand what they are looking to achieve. So we have an onboarding process
where we'd like to understand what they are looking to get out of it, and then we'll measure.
Around that, and then we'll also measure it around the return of investment. So, you know,
we'll look at how much they want to spend, and we'll basically try and bring a return of their
investment based off of how much they want to spend in their advertising budget.

05:16
Okay, got you.

05:20
And then statistics.

S

Speaker 1 05:21
So we'll, we'll look at the end of the month, we'll run a report and and we'll basically tell them
where they're at, in their, in their in their bro turn. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 05:34
amazing. Okay, so why did like in the instances when you look at taboo like story. Have you
actually used Taboola before?

S

Speaker 1 05:44
Yeah. So I have another client called GPL x, where I used it. I use you guys a lot, and I was
getting great results.

S

Speaker 2 05:50
Okay, so can you describe to me, like, why you were using Taboola? Why did you what? What
kind of client was it? What was the motivation? What led you to, try

S

Speaker 1 06:03
to public traded company, publicly traded company, and we run digital marketing specifically, I
use your platform to target potential investors.

S

Speaker 2 06:15
Oh, okay, wow, so it's Yeah,

S

Speaker 1 06:19
so I would run ads based off of what we do, and we would land I would send them to a landing
page to get them to sign up to for more information on how they can invest into the company.
Okay? And

S

Speaker 2 06:34
why did you pick Taboola for this specific use case?

why did you pick Taboola for this specific use case?

S

Speaker 1 06:39
You guys have very, very good targeting. You have a lot of categories that I can target that not
everybody allows me to do. You know, Facebook is limited, you know, I can build a persona, I
can build a kind of like a, you know, a customer. But you guys seem to have a lot more
categories that I can target. So that's

07:02
what kind of categories, for example.

S

Speaker 1 07:06
Oh, man. So when we were doing so for my main the biggest one that I use, when I use you a
lot, they were used, they were targeting high net worth individuals who owned houses we had
disposable in who I don't remember, if you've had an option in there to say if they had already
invested in companies or whatnot, but I was able to basically target and narrow down a lot of
different categories specific to what we were trying to attack.

S

Speaker 2 07:37
Okay, okay, amazing. So that's where I

S

Speaker 1 07:41
like, like Will is that you guys definitely have a lot of a lot of opportunities to target specifically.
Sorry, I have a lot

07:50
of opportunities to target and where to

S

Speaker 1 07:53
target specific groups, more categories, pretty much.

S

Speaker 2 07:57
Yep. Okay. Have you tried business a platform called out brain. By any chance,

08:05
say that again. Have you heard of out brain?

S

Speaker 1 08:08
Yes, Outbrain, yeah. Have you tried them? Yeah.

08:14
I think I used once or twice.

08:18
And how well think I've

S

Speaker 1 08:20
specifically you dug into them. But I do, I know I've heard before, okay, got it,

08:31
okay? And for

08:33
these guys merging,

S

Speaker 2 08:34
no, no, no, that's our top competitor. Um, oh, I see, God, by the way, I'm not in Taboola. It's like
Taboola is my client, so I'm just running these calls to get some insights for the team. So okay,
and that campaign that you were running for that those ads that you're running for this publicly
traded company, was what was the goal? Was it lead generation was a brand awareness. What
was the desired like? How are you measuring success multiple so

S

Speaker 1 09:08
we measure success based off of how many so full transparency, we use a platform called
customers that AI, I don't know if you've heard of that, okay, but they are an anonymous they
are anonymous, for example, what they call basically, what they do is they, they match up the

database information that they receive, I'm sorry, the cookie information that they receive with
their database, and then they they give you information that they have in the database based
off of that. And what we were doing is we were using Taboola to get volume. So I was using
Taboola to get tons of leads, basically not signing up, but just to get that anonymous data.

09:58
Okay, so just volume. Volume of data,

10:03
okay, of leads. And then

S

Speaker 1 10:04
we use Yeah, and then we have an in house call, call center, call person that then we'll call
those leads. That's

10:12
so brilliant, and maybe I'm going to use that

S

Speaker 1 10:17
Well, you better take me back some of that, wherever you make

S

Speaker 2 10:22
I will, I literally, I will, I will. Maybe we can find another time to chat about, like, my business
and like, maybe you guys can help

S

Speaker 1 10:30
me. Yeah, for sure, let me know. Did you visit the site, pondergrove.com Yes,

10:37
I have, but

10:40

10:40
I haven't gone into it in depth,

S

Speaker 1 10:42
yeah, so there's that. And then we also have Bob ponder Media group.com, and then online
printing, dot Vegas, okay, those are our three landing page slash lead gen sources.

10:56
Okay, amazing. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 10:59
back to this quickly. So if you were to kind of compare um Taboola against other platforms,
what would you say like, if you were to think of you're thinking about Taboola and all these
different platforms be for the different clients that you work with, their stages, the industry,
size, etc. What, how do you position Taboola like? How does it kind of compare? What's its like,
best features, its best, what is it best at getting you?

S

Speaker 1 11:27
It was just solely how many different ways that I could target my campaigns that was probably
the biggest thing

11:39
that could say. What do you can

S

Speaker 2 11:41
you can you be more specific about what you mean by targeting?

S

Speaker 1 11:46
So, like, I could, like I was saying I could target a person who makes over $250,000

11:52
a year, owns their house,

11:55
likes a specific

S

Speaker 1 11:59
thing. You have so many, it almost got overwhelming. I actually had to stop categorizing and
targeting, okay, but, you know, it was that it was more like, How can I narrow down my specific
persona that I'm trying to advertise

S

Speaker 2 12:15
to? Okay? So it's like, very specific niche persona,

S

Speaker 1 12:20
right? And I'm able to, I would, I haven't found anybody that has the amount of options that you
had that allowed me to target the people that I wanted to target.

S

Speaker 2 12:29
Okay, okay, got you, um, any frustrations that you had with the platform, like, any obstacles
that you kind of ran into while using the platform, like onboard, setting up a campaign, getting
things approved,

12:48
testing.

12:52
I'm not really the right person to ask that question, because I am

S

Speaker 1 12:58
naturally able to maneuver my way around platforms like this and it I don't get stuck very
often. And when I do, I kind of, like, just figure it out. So I'm not the right person to ask that
question, to be honest. Okay,

13:08
I love that. Yeah.

S

Speaker 2 13:12
Okay, um. And then in terms of, like, what you were expecting from the platform, I know
you've, like, been very successful with this one client, any like unmet expectations, like any
thing where, you know, you thought the platform would get x for you, but it actually got
something else.

13:35
Sorry, it's been about two years since I ran this campaign. Oh, okay, moving.

S

Speaker 1 13:43
Um, the only thing that I question is that the volume is real volume. It's real people. We were
capturing those emails, like I said, and that data on those people, we are making those calls
some obviously it's going to be based off of the data that we get from our third party,
anonymous data scraper, and obviously it's going to be based upon the people that actually
kind of do a physical form fill or phone call, which we really didn't measure as Well as we
should have, what that difference is. But I would say the one thing that I do question is whether
the views do add up to actual views and clicks and people who are actually visiting the site. It
seems too good to be true. I'm just going to keep

14:35
it real. Yeah, no, keep it all real with me.

S

Speaker 1 14:39
It just seemed too real for, I mean, I think I was, I think we captured like, 60,000 emails and
within, like, I want to say six months to

S

Speaker 2 14:48
a year, so that how many 60,000

S

Speaker 1 14:52
it was like, yeah, it was a lot. It was a lot.

S

Speaker 2 14:55

And it was 60,000 clicks in,

S

Speaker 1 14:59
in. That's what I said. Now, that's what I'm saying. I don't know if that was real or not, but that's
what we measure based off of your data and the leads that we captured,

15:08
sorry, 60,000 clicks in what period of time

15:12
it was probably about a year, maybe less.

15:22
Okay, are you pulling this up? Yeah, I

15:25
want to see if I can get back. So okay,

S

Speaker 1 15:38
I don't remember leaving. I believe. Bam. I don't know if you can look up GTO x in your system,
no. Or you probably don't even have access to these. No, no.

15:50
I don't have any access. Unfortunately, I

16:08
Okay, no, it's all good. No problem.

S

Speaker 1 16:12
Yeah, I mean, if you, if you send me, what email Do you have a problem? I have let

16:22
me see I have ron@pondergrowth.com

S

Speaker 1 16:27
Yeah, so if you send me an email, I can follow up with these things that I

16:32
that number just so you have it on.

16:35
Okay, cool. Um,

16:42
okay. If

S

Speaker 1 16:58
you guys had an opportunity to jump into the anonymous user data

17:02
industry that will probably be something to share with them.

S

Speaker 2 17:07
Tap into the anonymous user data industry.

S

Speaker 1 17:21
Okay? Little, it's a little you're basically, you know, depending, you're basing it off of the data in
your database that you can match up with the individuals. But, I mean, you guys are capturing
a lot of data, I'm sure, yeah, so sure that you could turn that data into something else. Yeah,
that's the thing. Yeah. How do you pivot? Yeah, and I can't log into the old account on here
such a long time.

17:55
No problem. No problem.

S

Speaker 2 18:01
Okay, this is incredibly valuable. Thank you so much for your time. You will be getting an
Amazon gift card on behalf of Taboola for this conversation, and I am going to keep you in mind
for myself.
