@0:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so the purpose of this conversation, so I'm a third party external from Tabula. So I am here, like I don't even know about, like I don't understand how Tabula works.

I don't know what a, you know, a digital advertising agency or marketing agency actually does and the utility of Tabula.

So I would love if you can kind of like break things down as I ask you some questions, as if you're speaking to some sort of five-year-old, not really five-year-old, maybe a ten-year-old.

And so, yeah, so I did check out your website super briefly, but I'm just going to go and ask you some questions and it's just going to be a conversation.

How does that sound to you? Sounds fine.



@0:53 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Okay, any questions that we have initially for me? Just want to double check. So when you were talking, about checking out our website.

Are you referring to DragonGoat.com? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so the most the more relevant website, the one that we were trying to drive people to for lead generation was actually a client of ours, and that is greasemonkey.com.



@1:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay.



@1:20 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Actually, it's greasemonkeyfranchise.com.



@1:26 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Grease. Grease like G-R-E like the country.



@1:30 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Grease? No, like a greasy axle. It's actually an oil change company. Oh, okay.



@1:38 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What's a cold story one more time?



@1:41 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Greaseemonkeyfranchise.com. Okay.



@1:46 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Okay, so I'm going to get get into this. I'm going to get some context on you first. Okay.

Okay. How would you describe your business?



@1:58 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

We are a- that digital marketing agency specializes in lead generation, especially for franchise processes that are looking to attract entrepreneurs.



@2:09 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Brandtize is looking to attract entrepreneurs.



@2:13 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Yes.



@2:15 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, I understand to manage their franchises and open more franchise.



@2:21 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Exactly. Okay.



@2:24 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

That's so specific. Wow. Yeah, pretty nichey. That's like, I've never heard of a niche, that niche. Okay. Okay. So, and how large is your client base, like roughly?



@2:51 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Usually we have about a half a dozen clients where we're boating.



@2:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, amazing. And in this. you know, this niche, what kind of services are you really providing that, like specifics?



@3:07 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Sure, so essentially we're providing digital advertising, digital marketing, SEO services, running Facebook advertising, Google advertising, LinkedIn advertising, and then other advertising as we see opportunities.

So Tabula would fit into that category. We also build websites for our clients and provide the content. So we do a lot of content marketing.



@3:49 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, wow, you guys are like full service. Yes. Okay. Okay. And what's your business model? Okay. Okay. Okay. clients on retainer with you?

Are you billing per the Like, how do you do that?



@4:05 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Yeah. Most of our clients are on retainer, particularly the franchise clients. know, we do, if we do a little bit of work with small businesses particularly, you know, we get asked by, you know, through a friend of a friend, contact sort of situation, or occasionally just come across a business that we really like and want to help.

You we'll do, you know, smaller engagements in the situations, but generally it's retainers with larger businesses. Okay.



@4:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And what you're, like, surprising offering, like, do you, like, take a fee of, you know, you take a cut of, you know, the ROI that you deliver?

Is it based on the service hours, like, how do you, how does that work?



@5:02 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Typically, when we're on a large retainer, it is a, it's just a flat retainer for everything we manage with some, you know, some defined limits on the service so that, you know, we don't get abused on the number and amount of requests.

But, you know, we offer a very full service approach often we'll just do a flat retainer so that people can be comfortable that A, we're going to take care of all the needs and B, our advertising recommendations are not colored by, you know, percentage of take on ads then.

You we do have that. We have had a handful of clients, including one at the moment, that really are just working with us on advertising.

And in that case, know, a flat retainer doesn't really make I haven't said we will do a percentage of ad spend or hourly building depending on the size of the 20 and what the needs are.

Okay.



@6:10 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

But that doesn't happen as often as you're just your flat retainer. Exactly, generally flat retainer.



@6:17 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Okay.



@6:20 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

so it's a very specific niche, your client base. Wow. I'm honestly amazed, by the way, if I ever hear of or come across anyone who needs this service, you will be top of mind.

I appreciate it.



@6:35 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Believe it or not, there's about probably about a thousand companies a year that are trying to grow in the fantastic space.

No, it's so brilliant.



@6:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

love it. Okay. So, tell me what to do. So it is a grease monkey franchise. The first, the first client of yours.

That you. you have been trying to use Tabula for? They are.



@7:04 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Yeah, essentially be smunky. And this is true of the automotive industry within the franchising, generally, has really struggled over the last year or so to generate high quality leads.

Automotive?



@7:25 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, automotive.



@7:26 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Specifically, the automotive industry within the franchising industry, the automotive sector within the franchising industry has really struggled to attract new franchisingers over the last little bit more than a year.



@7:45 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. And this is industry-wide. This is like not. Okay. No, it's not specific to grease monkey.



@7:53 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

It's, yeah. mean, I'm sure there are individual bright spots within the industry, like always. But no, it's an industry-wide trend that like, you know, franchise, new franchises, I think are down 56 or 57% in 2024 compared to 2023.

Okay.



@8:15 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I mean, significant.



@8:17 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Okay.



@8:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And so, what did you previously, okay, how long have they been a client of yours for?



@8:29 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

They've been a kind of Irish for about three and a half years. Okay.



@8:34 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And what have you done to generate leads for them in the past?



@8:39 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Well, we built a new website for them. So, new website, content marketing, SEO services, a lot of Google ads and Facebook advertising as the primary ad channels.

And then lead nurture, you know, email. things to try to get and nurture new leads. Okay.



@9:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And how has that all been going?



@9:11 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Pretty great until last year. Okay. Yeah, the first two years where everything was working very well, last year things really hit a wall.

So we decided to try a couple of new things toward the end of last year, one of which was to boot it up.

Okay.



@9:39 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What other things did you consider?



@9:41 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Well, we also tried audio go, so that's a podcasting platform. So we launched a little bit of podcast advertising and then I recommended that we did not yet have the assets to do this.

targeted OTT advertising, which is which is basically when you have ads that show up on like the ad-supported versions of Hulu or Amazon or platforms like Quiddo TV, for instance, so it's really targeted streaming to you advertising.



@10:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so interesting. Okay, and in the case of Dubu, it's very different from like TV, streaming advertising and podcasting platform, Were you considering any other like native advertising platform?

one of did you consider then? We did not. Okay. Have you heard of them? Yeah, I have.



@11:09 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Okay.



@11:12 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Why not? Like any reason, any particular reason for why not?



@11:18 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Honestly, I think just word of mouth with tabula. Really, truly.



@11:26 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Okay. And so what were your, tell me about, know, so your, your client never mentioned tabula. you, you decided to come up with that concept of going, like trying these new things.

That was you guys, not your client.



@11:53 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Well, the client wanted us to attempt to look for any sort of new ways to try to reach, reach.

buyers. So we started looking at options that we felt like would allow us to reach a very targeted niche audience.

And Tabula was one of the options that we settled on as a test. Mm hmm.



@12:20 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. So targeted. Right. Like the goal is to get a very specific audience in this scenario. Okay. And was the campaigns and the motivations for these campaigns?

Was it more like lead gen brand awareness? Like what level of the funnel were you looking to target?



@12:46 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

We were looking to drive brand awareness among a very, very, very specific audience in the hopes of, you know, generating some math.

Obviously, we would love to have some early lead generation, but primarily we were looking to make sure that we weren't known as an opportunity within this audience.



@13:20 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and so how long have you been using Tibula for and trying to...



@13:30 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

We actually only used Tibula for a month, we used it in December of 2024.



@13:40 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, tell me about it.



@13:42 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Well, we ran a approximately $2,000 campaign, and we were hoping to target a very, would be looking to diversify their business holdings and okay you're looking to target people in a different niche than grease monkeys niche yes so essentially within franchising you you often have people that have multiple formats of businesses you know you might have somebody who owns 50 subway stores and then eight minuses right so what we had noticed with a handful of the bright spots in the automotive industry they were connected to large private equity companies that had multiple brands and essentially what appeared what appears to be happening is that

large multi-unit restaurant operators who own, you know, 20, 30 restaurants were starting to invest in some automotive chains as a way to diversify.

okay. And part of that is, you know, looking to, I think it was looking to hedge against food costs and employees in labor costs, part of it, people on the flip side, it is the cost of starting automotive has gone up.

So I think that some companies were looking for people that were better capitalized and would be able to deal with higher interest rates lending and real estate development costs.

Okay. So we decided to try to tap into that audience as well. So that's. essentially we were targeting restaurant operators and we thought might be interested in diversifying their holdings.



@16:08 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay so how did that actually go?



@16:13 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Pretty poorly that's why we only did it for a month. Yeah it didn't it didn't seem to drive a whole lot of traffic we did get some leads but the leads that came in the world were really really really really bad.

What do you mean by that? They were... I say this? I'll put it this way. A lot of it was people just kind of entering all your stuff into the form fields or like obviously fake data.



@17:01 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Oh, so they were not were they bots or were they real people?



@17:06 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Um, I think that a couple of them may have been bots. I think some of them were real people that were just putting.

Crap. In the form fields. Forable.



@17:26 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, so I mean just.



@17:29 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

You know, I think we got like a couple of out of. Seven people who filled out forms while this campaign was active.

I think two of them may have argued they've been. Real. Okay. One of them looks to have been like.

You know, a decently. I don't think any of them picked up the sound. when we reached out.



@18:06 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Wow, okay. what were you? So it kind of seemed like this was a little bit of an experiment. Absolutely.

So what did you actually expect?



@18:30 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

I was expecting, honestly, I wasn't expecting to see many leads. I was expecting that the leads that we did see would be decent quality and that we wouldn't see so much what I'll call spank or junk leads.

And then, you know, what I was largely expecting, and this would have been a longer play, currently, if the client.

and kind of pulled the plug on the basis of some of the junk leads that were coming in. What I would have expected long term is to start to see a left with more interest from the audience.

Not necessarily coming from or directly from Tabula clicks, but coming in through secondary sources. Now the nice thing is, as some of the tracking that we have on the website, we can see if somebody clicks a Tabula ad to get to the site.

Lee goes somewhere else, comes back in through a Google organic structure in Google ad or Facebook ad. However else they reach this site, we can see through a click, but we are

So looking to see just a lift in interest from our audience that we were targeting, which, you know, may have come in through just organic search, might not have been a conflict from Tabula, they may have seen the Tabula add thanks to the targeting, and then ultimately done a search and come to the site that way.



@20:24 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Right, like seeing, like they saw an ad and they came to you not directly to the ad, but through, like you mentioned, the secondary source.



@20:34 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Is that what you mean?



@20:35 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. Okay, let me just clarify that in my note here.



@20:48 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

And unfortunately, we just didn't see that either. So you didn't really, okay, but for now, now in fairness, I will.

would expect the campaign to need to run for longer than a month to be able to see a really noticeable impact on audience dynamics through secondary sources.

So I'm not sure that the client gave Tabula a totally fair shot, but I will say that the junk leads that were coming in through it, uh, speak to them.



@21:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. So your client did term decided when they wanted to stop running the ad.



@21:45 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Yeah, they told us to turn it off. Yeah, and we just, you know, told them at the time, it's like, you know, we essentially had a set ad spend that was almost complete at the time.

And so we just essentially did not continue.



@22:03 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So from what I asked you previously, know, what were your desired outcomes in the type of campaigns? And you basically said, brand awareness, and your goal was like to be known as an opportunity within this audience with the hopes generating some leads out of it.

It seems like, you know, how you measured success here was, you know, your expectations, what you were really looking for was like people filling out the lead form.



@22:38 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Ultimately, yes.



@22:45 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Right. So, you know, what, based on what you know but tabula or not know but tabula, were you expecting?

I guess I maybe there were not clear expectations, but in an ideal world, if you do this again, would it be helpful to have had some sort of like understanding of how much money you need to put into this to actually start seeing all of the leads?



@23:20 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

I mean, I think that having some guidance along those lines would be helpful. Full now, as I recall, there was some guidance as far as how much reach you were likely to have based on your charging parameters and your ad budget, so I mean that was helpful in itself.

If there was an added layer of if your goal is to generate X number of leads within X time frame, we suggest X budget.

Yeah, I think that that would be a helpful metric to make. available to people that are evaluating the platform and then considering setting up campaigns.

Okay.



@24:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, because what it seems like is like lead generation is like the number one priority here, as it usually is, right?



@24:16 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Yeah, I mean, it is, but it's, you know, it's also a bit of shortage. You have to be able to build brand awareness within them.

know, nobody is making a gigantic purchase, right, quickly on the basis of just, you know, a handful of ads, you know, that that needs to build.

So, yeah, I think that the larger issue in terms of the client being speed is, um, the leads that were coming in were just really bad.

Right, right. Like I think if there had been very few leads, but the very few leads that had come in were stronger, I think that like two really good leads would have been much, much better than seven leads and six of them were atrocious and one of them was midland.



@25:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Right, okay.



@25:32 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Okay, yeah. And then also, I think making the reach with the reach and that probably failed with me because I think that I won't say that because the client kind of freaked out based on the lead quality initially.

So I'm not sure it would have mattered, but illustrating the reach within the target audience was also a very handy metric when it comes to bringing awareness obviously.



@26:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So that one more time, I'm going to note this, do you mind repeating that?



@26:12 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

I think that Tabula already does a good job of illustrating how well you're reaching your target audience. And that's a very useful metric for brand awareness campaigns.

I think that the difficulty that we ran into with our client was just that the lead inequality itself was so initially weak that I think that overwhelmed any other evidence of performance.

Okay.



@26:52 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Hmm. Okay. So. What do you propose would be valuable for you to almost suggest to your client? Like, what kind of data or numbers or store, like, what kind of message would be valuable?



@27:13 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

Well, the most valuable message initially from the list and from a list standpoint really is the, here's the audience you're trying to reach an influence.

Here's, here's the percentage of audience that you've reached. Here's the number of touches that you've had in terms of impressions and click the rights.

And here is an anticipated based on these other two performances. When you might expect to see leads ramp up, if you all were able to build a projection or suggest a calculator that marketers could use to build that projection.

that might help, the other thing is just. Wait, sort of interrupt you.



@28:06 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Like, actually have a calculator on a dashboard or something? Yeah. For the client to calculate, and you kind of guide them through that.



@28:24 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

For the client to be able, basically for your customer, for to be able to be able to be able to do that.

And also we're getting close to 4.30, and I'm gonna have to drop. Okay, okay. So do you have any other questions that you need to finish off?



@28:39 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

No, I think this is actually extremely thorough and super helpful. Okay. Yeah. Thank you so much. And so this is, yeah, I guess one more question.

Would you consider using Tableau again, like to test it out with something else? Or, you know, if it's only these metrics and these, if you got higher quality leads, some of the pieces of feedback that you provided would have changed, would lead you to use the platform again.



@29:14 - Dan Hieb (DragonGoat)

So I would want to have a little bit of consultation on how to avoid junk leads coming in the clients.

So, in any sort of customer success guidance on how to suppress some of the worst leads would be helpful.

And then as far as using it again in the future, I would, I don't think I would use it again with a client that is so focused on immediate high ROI and immediate lead generation because I think that Taboo was much more of a brand awareness.

I. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. so I would essentially, if I were to try it again, only do it probably with the expectation from a client that we are going to try it for at least a full quarter.

Right. Yeah. So, yeah. Those are the scenarios. Okay.



@30:22 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah. Makes sense. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time and I hope you have a good rest of your day.

All right. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
