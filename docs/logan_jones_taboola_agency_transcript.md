@0:00 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Anything that we discussed today?



@0:02 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So it will help tabula Understand you'll like kind of see in the questions that I ask you, but it'll help them really understand, you know or expectations your motivations Your desired outcome some of the problems that you have already There's a term called job is to be done.

You might have heard of it through Bob Moesta and it's really to understand like what is the Desired goal that you're trying to achieve and how can tabula, you know prioritize what you know, where the gaps are So it's not being used for marketing purposes or anything like that.

No, like this conversation is not for marketing. It's for like the team Self-service team the self-service team is trying to figure out how can you know, we better onboard new customers and Make it more seamless to

Use the platform and achieve your desired outcomes. Okay.



@1:05 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Yeah.



@1:06 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And I am an independent third party. This is my business. Um, we do is we have conversations like this, totally like unfiltered, just.

Figure out, you know, what are you trying to achieve and where they're unmet expectations and challenges and, um, really gather some context as well into who you are.

Because tubula doesn't, you know, their self-service seem to really have a technical point with the customer. It's very much a digital interaction.

um, this is kind of bridges, bridges that relationship. Sure.



@1:37 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Okay.



@1:38 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Um, so digital marketing advertising, um, company and how many people do have on your team?



@1:45 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Uh, we work with a very small team and then we hire everyone else, third party or contract work out, right?

So, um, all the core things that are touching to those platform is one of three people.



@1:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so you, so the people using.



@2:00 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

tabula are outsourced no no the people using tabula are me or the two other people in the firm and then for everything else we do for as an agency on our end we then you know use third party resources ourselves we manage team of contractors and things like that what do you contract out oh we contract out a variety of different things i mean we all just advertise on sites like tabula we do web design we do more niche marketing we do product development with people we do you know we help people organize corporate decks you know it depends on the type of client working we also do product sales things like that okay got you um so you and your internal team are using tabula yes okay and what is your actual service offering via tabula i mean we provide market visibility based advertising for companies marketing based visibility advertising so brand awareness level ads you know so

product type ads, things like that. That's what we're doing through Tiubula.



@3:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. And what's your business model? how is that service kind of positioned? You tell your customers that they should use Tiubula, do they, do you tell them they should, like, how does that work?



@3:19 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Our customers don't care what platforms we use for advertising, what they care about is whether we generate results. So we choose whatever platform or medium advertising generates the best results for each specific campaign we run for our clients.

Oftentimes, we'll use Tiubula as part of the overall booking strategy, or if somebody's operating on a more limited budget, we might recommend Tiubula specifically, but we also use one of your key competitors, outbrain, and then we do, you know, more specific marketing, like direct ad buys, things of that nature.

Okay.



@3:51 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I'm just processing what you're saying. Okay. So in which specific instances, Do you use Tabula?



@4:01 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

When we're trying to reach specific audiences that are available through your audience groupings on specific sites and or platforms.

So, you know, for example, if somebody is, if you guys have the audience group that we like, that we're trying to reach for specific type of campaign, then we would use Tabula for that type of campaign as one of the methodologies.

If somebody's trying to run a also, if someone's trying to run a high-level brand awareness type campaign, then Tabula and Outbrain are both good options because your bid-based marketplace for advertising can be very efficient if executed properly in terms of getting the name out there to as many eyeballs as possible.



@4:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And when would you use Outbrain?



@4:46 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Outbrain has access to different inventory that Tabula doesn't necessarily have access to. it's really, know, specific sites. So, it really depends on where the client wants to advertise what type of campaign we're running.

So, it's really It be very specific, right? Since we're a niche type marketing agency, it's really all down to what the client is looking for.

And then we problem-solve and craft campaigns based on that desire.



@5:12 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You mean the end client? Yes.



@5:16 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Okay.



@5:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So, you said it depends on where the client wants to advertise in the type of campaign. Like, where your client wants to advertise or where the end customer's market lies?



@5:31 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Both. So, let's say, for example, we're working with a publicly traded company in the U.S. And they want to specifically, for whatever reason, to people who work in the neuroscience sector, researchers, academics, things like that.

So, in that scenario, we would have to go outside of the bullet system to try and target those people.

In another scenario. and a target high net worth individuals that are worth X and own real estate, the BULA has a decent collection of that data, so then we might use TABULA for that campaign.

Okay, so it's very audience specific. Correct.



@6:17 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and are there certain types of clients that you use TABULA for?



@6:24 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

No, in that sense, we're kind of agnostic. So it's really just audience targeting specific, whether TABULA or any other platform has those capabilities.

Sometimes our clients express specific desires to directly advertise in certain places, like say they wanted to add by on Bloomberg, right?

Then we would go straight to Bloomberg for that. Even though TABULA has access to a small portion of the inventory, we don't have the same type of controls over how TABULA delivers ads, or we would if we went straight to Bloomberg itself in that one scenario.



@7:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and then in terms of your actual business model, just side note here, do you build based on like results, like how does that actually work?



@7:23 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

We operate with three different options depending on the type of client and campaign we're working with. One is we offer them an all-inclusive fee with guaranteed results, right?

We tell them we're going to get due to this many clicks, or we're going to get due to this many ad views, know, impressions, know, that sort of thing, and then they'll sign on to that.

And then we include our management fee into the cost with the budget in that scenario for the campaign. That's what we do for clients that have smaller campaigns, generally speaking.

When a client is looking to run a very large or robust advertising campaign, then we tend to charge a flat management fee, and then we give them a monthly budget.

right and then they just they get whatever the budget produces via whatever platform we're going off. In the third types of campaigns we run which again we're in niche agencies so sometimes they're results based.

We get a flat fee or a base fee and then we get a percentage based on capital raised or products sold or something like that and that's where we're taking more risk as an agency in terms of executing where we almost become an investment partner in the business of our client.



@8:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Nice. Okay so from what I'm so far is you in terms of how you use tabula it's more like like brand awareness ads.

Your customers are coming to you purely for results they don't really care what platform although they do suggest sometimes like you mentioned Bloomberg and when you use because you're in need.

niche marketing advertising agency. The platform you decide to use is dependent on where the specific audience lies, and you use each of these platforms as part of your methodology to reach those audiences.

One of the things that you like about Dubula is that it's a bid-based marketplace, which is very efficient.



@9:26 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

It can be because we have machine learning based operating in the background on our end, and that's why, you know, if any Dubula account manager were to look at our accounts, they'd see that what we're bidding for space on different sites, we control each site individually, and we bid our bids dynamically change, so because we can be most efficient on the platform.

It also is that's all related to where we run into the most issues trying to operate within the Google API link.

It's just difficult. Recalling individuals. It's can be difficult because there's caps to how many you can adjust bids on and there's caps to how many you can block There's a lot of garbage sites that pop up in an ad campaign for tibula unfortunately You know things like that nature the greater control we have Over the ability to target specific individuals or customers with ads Combined with the greater control we have over how the ads are delivered Would continuously increase the value we see in tibula's platform And i'm assuming that most marketing agencies do not have this Running in the back end No, um, that is part of what makes us niche and different and it's why we get, you know Publicly traded companies looking to you know drive awareness stuff like that on a higher level Um, it's what we do is a little bit different than trying to sell, you know Be sure it's your sneakers or things like that.

You're trying to find Very specific people and companies when you can do it, companies are willing to compensate a lot for that, and they're willing to pay a lot for that in advertising.

We would love to be able to use to bully even more extensively than we currently do. The issue is sometimes we're running through, isn't quite enough control over what we can do, and there isn't quite enough optionality in how we can execute campaigns on the platform.

It's very good, but there are a couple areas of improvement. But I imagine those are very server-intensive on the bull's side.

The other issue we run into with the bull of almost every single time we go to build out a campaign is the automatic review process of ads.

It blocks things as a default sometimes that would otherwise be approved, and then when you go to have them reviewed, you escalate it in request review, sometimes it's like they don't even read them, and sometimes one person approves something, then another one cannot.

And then they take your ads that have previously been approved when they looked at them the second time and they're like, oh, this should have been approved and then they cancel it in the middle of campaign, even though it was signed off on by Tupola before.

There could be some improvement in that whole compliance review process that happens within Tupola to make it, well, more efficient or better.

If it's an AI-based tool that's using the review, it should be like an instantaneous review. If it's a person, they should follow the same standards no matter who is reviewing it.

In theory, anyway.



@12:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. So what exactly happened there? You said someone or something approved it and then they disapprove it?



@12:44 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Yeah, so I'll submit an ad and let's say I use, we'll call it one sentence for the ad and one image and I'll submit that same exact language in five different ad variants, each one with a different picture.

and three of them get approved and two don't. Okay, even though the pictures are, you know, straight out of whatever Adobe Freestock, whatever it is, that's fine, right?

happens. And then when you go to say, okay, we're going to update those two rejected images to something else, innocuous, and we do that, then those will get approved and we'll have like four of them going.

then I'll deal with the final one and it's like, okay, the fifth should get approved. And then they're like, oh, no, this language is wrong.

And then they go back and they cancel all five of them, even though four of them have already been approved at this point.

It can be a little annoying as a process, especially because in a situation our clients sign off on every single ad language and text that appears.

some of these things are based on publicly available information that's taking straight from a company's corporate website and to boot the client of any way.



@13:55 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Oh my god. Okay.



@14:02 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

That's a less, that is less of an issue, right, because I imagine that just has to do with the systems or the people that are doing the reviews.

It seems like they're not exactly looking at the ad and clicking through to the link and checking against the company that we're advertising for, but that is less of an issue than the value that could be improved by being able to have greater control over ad deliveries within campaigns on a targeting side, as well as on the website control side.

For example, you can target in tabula people who have a certain amount of money and you can target in tabula people who own real estate.

What you can't do is separate it so that you're targeting only people who own real estate who also make a certain amount of money.

If you get what I'm saying, like within the tabula marketplace audiences, if you could do that, then you'd be able to target, say, high net worth real estate owners.

As opposed to just all real estate owners, or all high net worth individuals.



@15:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Right. It's like the combinations of who you could target. Yes.



@15:08 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

So sort of how you can do like a Venn diagram type thing, you want to be able to target the overlapping segment, that allows you to go super niche and really focus in on delivering ads to those people.

Simultaneously, you might have to bid more for the space because it's harder to reach them, which is generating more money for Tabula, you know, potentially.

So it's like everybody wins in that scenario. Okay.



@15:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So that's something that Tabula does not offer, that level of deep targeting. Correct.



@15:37 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

And if they did, it would be valuable. Because not really very few people out there are offering anything like that in terms of inventory availability.



@15:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I don't use Tabula, by the way, I'm a third party, like I'm not part of Tabula. I'm in.



@16:00 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

ended.



@16:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. And that's why you use outbrain. Or some of the other competitors that are out there.



@16:11 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

That's an example of why we might have to go straight to somebody like Bloomberg. Okay. Something like that, you know, where or straight to Yacht and finance or direct to an ABC local affiliate in states, know, or whatever country we're advertising in.

And we need to go, the more niche we need to go on a campaign, the less available to the sites like Tebula and Outbrain become, because they don't quite have that same targeting capability.

Or at least they, at least not that I'm aware of. That's part of why we end up being more focused on brand awareness level campaigns on Tebula as a platform.

Because a brand awareness campaign, you're a little bit less focused on that ability to hyper niche target somebody.



@17:12 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Makes complete sense. Okay, predominantly Brandon, I'm just checking like all the things that I have to ask you.

But you may not have covered. How would you say, if you were to describe the value of TABULA to your business, how would you describe that?

It's valuable.



@17:45 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

We incorporate into our campaigns when we can. Right? liked using TABULA as a platform. We've written code on our end so that we can link with TABULA and analyze what's happening and all of those things.

nested on our end into the utilization of to pool as a platform. So the goal or the ideal would be that it improves, right, or continues to improve.

It's not bad now by any means. It would just be like, can it be improved further so that we can then use it even more, right?

As a company ourselves.



@18:21 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

How would you describe, like, if you were to describe its value proposition in marketing terminology, like, what would you describe as the value?

What does it help you achieve?



@18:34 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Reach and scale. The ability to scale up a campaign quickly and reach an audience in variety places. That's the core value, especially on the brand awareness side.

The ability to consolidate and manage a campaign from one location, right? You don't have to go to CNN, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, ABC, CBS, Fox, each individually.

You can run a campaign through Tipple. But you can reach all of them with the same campaign. And that is valuable.



@19:14 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And how does that compare to Outbrain? Does it? Does Outbrain have the same thing?



@19:21 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Outbrain is to build as close as So there's a lot of similarities in overlap there. The use of one versus the other.

And just like we have TABULA, have developed tools and things like that that integrate into Outbrain. And it really comes down to, at this stage, who we're targeting, how we're targeting them.

our client has specific preferences, what their budget is, sometimes we're running campaigns on both the same time for the same client to give even greater reach.

And that's because you guys are, you guys, TABULA is competing with Outbrain for after says the inventory across the internet.

I can say that if the bullet can improve that website management piece and that targeting piece, the niche targeting Venn diagrams, those would both be competitive differentiators.

Outbrain struggles with those same exact components. So it's like whoever can get their first will end up gaining more market share, delivering more effective campaigns, likely making more money and having more satisfied agencies that are using them and clients that are using them.

That said, I don't think many people out there diving into the inner workings of how ad delivery works on a platform with Ebola, agencies or marketers specifically.

But my background kind of sends me down that data analytics approach. So I'm pushing the limits, I think, what the Ebola is capable of currently.



@20:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

OK, I'll find that out for more conversations.



@21:00 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

to people like you and okay and then the website management piece what do you mean by that like when you upload ads and getting things approved what are you referring to as a website management you mentioned your website management or admin the thing there was second piece of what to look and improve on oh the compliance review process within tableau for imagery and for yeah as well as you know like we're having this conversation to bullets right exclusively digital it can be difficult under a time crunch try and get something reviewed and approved but those are all secondary considerations in my mind to the targeting related pieces right those are those to me are the key things that would enhance tools value from my perspective yep okay



@22:01 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

If you were to say, okay, to be compared to bullet to outbrain, they're very, very similar. At the beginning, you had mentioned that you use, like when you need to target a specific niche that you can't target on to bullet, you would outbrain.



@22:23 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

We have mostly sites, right, when I need access to certain sites because the client has a preference, or in certain cases, it's very situationally dependent.

can be day of week, it can be time of year, sometimes I find it's more efficient from a cost perspective to advertise on outbrain than it is on table.

But it's very dynamic, just like our systems that we use to manage campaigns are dynamic. So yeah, outbrain has access to different inventory, outbrain sometimes can be a little bit cheaper from an effectiveness perspective, which allows us to be more

efficient with our campaigns, but otherwise, they're very similar. I wouldn't say that outbrain is better than toola. I would say my preference is to use toola over outbrain.



@23:12 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Why?



@23:14 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

On our end, the system integration is easier, but that's because we have these back end tools that we've developed on our end to help us manage our campaigns.

So for us, it's more efficient, labor-wise for us to manage campaigns via toola currently.



@23:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And how would you, like, if you're just put a brand to boot a brand to boot in a category and then other advertising platforms in another category, how would you kind of compare the platform?

Like, what would you use describe as difference. Save like Google or meta.



@24:05 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

Well, okay, they're completely different in my mind, right? Google, you have virtually no control over how your ads are delivered.

You can do the targeting related pieces, especially when you get into their higher level solutions, but you have virtually no control over the specific site that the ads are delivered to or where you're trying to catch people.

So if you're trying to catch somebody while they're looking at financial and financial related news, you can't necessarily target them on a specific site.

Google is much better in terms of the whole SEO-related pieces, right? Because all the other things that they have attached to them, SEO, search-based advertising, all those things to pull it out and simply don't offer them.

So if you're trying to meet a customer need in the marketplace, for example, you're trying to find people looking to buy jeans, it's very easy to target them on a place like Google.

because you can do search-affiliated advertising and somebody types and they're looking for genes and that your ad pumps up.

I find that Google is also a very saturated marketplace. It's considerably more expensive advertising Google than it is on Tibule, or Alpering, on a cost per click basis, or a cost per million impressions basis, or cost per thousands or whatever.

Meta is also different. Meta, Instagram, and I'll throw in like typical based advertising as well. You're targeting a completely different audience group.

You're positioning things differently. You're looking more at video type ads on those platforms as opposed to static. Again, cost is higher, similar to Google's.

And what I would say is if you're selling things like consumer discretionary, retail clothes, shoes, things like that, those are all or services.

Those can all be pretty good places for them. All the meta's and some of the Google stuff out there too.

on the Google GDS network. But it's more expensive. So if you're trying to sell a specific product, those are good channels to consider.

If you're focused on something like more like brand awareness, to rule out gets you a lot more impressions and more clicks for a fraction of the cost.

So it's kind of the type of campaign you're running. And that's one of those things where if we have a client, some of them will be like, we want to rank first on Google.

Those Google's 70% of the search market. So then you basically have to run a Google related campaign. You have to improve their SEO.

You have to do those things. And then as appropriate, you would supplement with Tabula or Outbreak, right? Some people are saying we really want to improve our social presence.

So then you're going to run a campaign that's more focused on Instagram, TikTok, meta. And then you're going to supplement with things like Google, Tabula, Outbreak.

Or you're going to go and influence our strategy. So it's really, there's types of campaigns. There's types of advertising you're doing whether you're trying to sell products or drive awareness, and there's a couple of other factors But generally with all of those meta Instagram TikTok Google Your you don't have as much control over the advertising you're doing.



@27:18 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You're really you're really just linking into their platform to get out there Okay, so what I'm understanding is like if the type of preferred meta TikTok on Instagram is more like the type of product It's less related to branded awareness.

It's more for actually selling something like a like clothing And you've less control over the platform Right Okay, it's because it's more expensive.



@27:46 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

So you have to have a high ROI or advertising spend Right a brand awareness campaign is inexpensive on to bullet and out brand And they work well a a if you're gonna spend $4 getting some of the

click on mad one time on Google or Facebook, know, or on meta or something, then, and you're trying to get 100,000 people to click.

Not too many companies are looking to spend $400,000 unless they're selling something in return. Right. So even if they're not getting a one-to-one ROI or better, they need to be seeing tangible progress very quickly.

Right, right. Just if you were to spend $400,000 on Tabular Outbrain, you'd get over a billion ad impressions. You know, you're reaching a crazy, like, significantly greater number of people, but you're also not trying to sell anything in that scenario.

I mean, you can, and it can be effective doing it, but it's not as effective as like a search-based campaign because in that scenario, the person's already looking for the product that you're showing them.

You know, using Google as an example.



@28:54 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So in what instance? So brand awareness. Imagine I know nothing about marketing. What would be the goal of a brand awareness campaign with Tabula?

What would, yeah, what would be the desired outcome? Just like clicks and impressions?



@29:12 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

No, so what we would say is it's ultimately engagement, which isn't driven by Tabula's platform, right? So from a Tabula campaign perspective, the goal would be impressions and clicks.

And then from there, what we do, which is different than some other marketing agencies, is we connect directly into our clients platform, whatever it is, their website, their Shopify, whatever it is.

So we can see everything the people we're clicking on the ads are doing. And then we use that to provide strategic recommendations to our clients on how they can improve presentation of their materials, how they can drive further engagement on their end.

So the ultimate goal is to drive that engagement. Then as needed, we use those learnings to go back to the Tabula campaign.

refine the ads that were showing, change the length, update the language, change the targeting so that we can continue to drive more and more engagement on the client side.

So, brand awareness, if you think of it as a funnel, the brand awareness piece that the bullet piece, the impressions is the top of the funnel, the widest part.

And then we get the clicks, which is narrowing of the funnel, then we track all the engagement of the people on the site once they clicked on the campaign, which narrows the funnel further.

We then develop learnings, we provide strategic recommendations, and then we continue to refine and narrow the wide part of the funnel, initial brand awareness campaign on the bullet, to drive greater and greater results, to essentially make the funnel longer, so to speak, to ultimately drive an action, whether it's a purchase of a product.

Or, you know, somebody to learn about materials if they want, if we want them to download a clinical trial results or something like that, whatever it is, to drive that.

And then that helps. form our client's strategy on what they want to do in other areas of marketing and product development and design and things like that website you know design whatever they're doing on their end trying to help them with.

Okay very cool amazing.



@31:18 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

The last segment that I spoke with was people who are independent online shop owners and speaking with someone who is like fully proficient in each of these platforms is I know it's eye opening because yeah I personally have a different perspective on the value proposition of the product sort of the platform.

No like just from hearing from you like previously these people are not marketeers they are e-commerce brand owners trying to sell a product and have not figured out how



@33:00 - Logan Jonas (Hunting Data)

simple example, similar to your e-commerce shop owners that you've been talking to. They're typically trying to sell a product or service.

So where we start the conversation is not, OK, you're trying to sell plumbing repair services, you're trying to sell t-shirts.

We don't have the conversation from there. We say, what are your revenue goals for the year? And what are you currently on track to do?

And what is the gap that you're trying to achieve? And if they say, well, we're on track to do $1 million worth of sales, our goal is to $2 million this year.

So there's an identified gap of $1 million they need to hit. And then what we would do is we would say, OK, have you tried in the past?

we do an evaluation of any ROIs they have from previous campaigns and things like that. we create a model for them.

We say, based on what you're trying to achieve, million in sales, and based on what you've passed performance. based on our expertise and knowledge of whatever is you're trying to do.

We create a projection for them. Here's a campaign, right? Here's the portion we're going to dedicate to the gula and here's how much it's going to cost, approximately.

And then that way they know what they need to spend. There's projected ROI attached to it. We give them comparisons against things like if they ran the campaign on Google, if they ran the campaign on meta.

Now if they did an Instagram focused campaign, if they did video ads as opposed to static ads, we create all these projections for and that creates essentially performance metrics where over the life of the campaign, we're giving them a projection of here's what you should expect each week each month, you know, the campaign gets up and running, here's the projection we gave you.

Are we on track to hit the target of your million dollars worth of sales? If not, how do we adjust with all the learnings we're getting out of the campaign, what's working and what's not?

So it's a strategic scientific approach. So to go back to your initial question of, you know, how do we start

It depends on what they're trying to do. If you're trying to sell a million dollars with the t-shirts, you have to expect that you're going to spend, you know, quarter million dollars in ads, maybe, right, depending on the type of campaign you're looking to run, and so you're trying to sell $10,000 worth of t-shirts, your budget's going to be much smaller.

So we work with clients that spend anywhere from, you know, $1,000 a month on advertising campaigns, which are like friends and family type rates that will work with them from just a referral, something we know to companies that spend $50,000 $100,000 a month on advertising campaigns.

It's just all dependent on the types of campaigns they're looking to run. Usually we don't spend more fur on a campaign than like $5,000 or $10,000 in a specific month on the Bula specifically, but we might be doing $2,500 on the Bula and $2,500 on the Outbrain and $10,000 on Google and $15,000 on Meta, you know, for one client, right, they might be, you know, doing different things and then helping them get specific placement on like, you know, a social website.

or ESPN or something like that. So, so there's a wide net and tool as a part of it. But ideally, the blue would be more of it.

Okay.



@36:13 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Wow, if I ever need to sell something, I'm going to go to you.
