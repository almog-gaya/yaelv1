@0:09 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

@0:11 - Moe Farhat

What about that? keep having issues. been a rough couple of weeks to be honest. What?



@0:18 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What's been going on?



@0:20 - Moe Farhat

Both of my kids, my twins are were sick. yesterday when you called me, my son was sick and has been vomiting that entire day.

Yes, but he's good today.



@0:31 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I think the same thing with the other one.



@0:35 - Moe Farhat

The other one has 102 temperature fever for a couple of days and scared the hell out of us. Oh, my God.



@0:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

That's crazy.



@0:47 - Moe Farhat

Six and a half. Oh, my God.



@0:50 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

They're so cute. Yes. Yes.



@0:53 - Moe Farhat

Also, which one? Oh, are you? I am.



@0:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Wow.



@0:58 - Moe Farhat

That's awesome.



@0:59 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Two girls.



@1:00 - Moe Farhat

Oh man, mine is two boys and oh yeah, tell me about the trouble, but I think it's a good thing for them because they're best friends, right?

you still best friend with your sister? Yeah, we're best friends like me.



@1:13 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I live in Tel Aviv now. She's in Toronto, but it's so the time difference is really tough, but we're like always calling each other back and forth and like keeping their updated on life and it's good.

Wow, that's amazing. Yeah.



@1:28 - Moe Farhat

Yeah. That's good. Okay, so is it true that they say that you guys can feel each other too? Like there's an emotional feeling that's shared between both of you?

Is that true between twins basically?



@1:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I mean, I don't know. I think we understand each other, but I feel like with my younger sister, she's eight years younger than me and we look smaller and our personalities are some more similar.

We really love each other. We're like this. She's my real twin. we joke about that. But I don't know, I think with twins, you spend a lot of time with each other, you just kind of get to know each other really well.

And you're in each other's minds.



@2:13 - Moe Farhat

All right, so let's get going. Tell me.



@2:17 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So what I'm doing is I'm getting feedback from you and trying to understand how you used to below a little bit of your agency.

So I'm just going to ask you some questions and then you can share everything you got with me. Yep, go ahead.

So what kind of business do you run?



@2:34 - Moe Farhat

So right now, I own an agency, a web design, design and development agency, currently myself. And we have about 40 developers and designers.

And sometimes we use tabula for us, but it didn't really work and I was upset. And sometimes we use tabula for our clients.

So I asked them, hey, stand up with tabula and then we use it for them. Which one you want to talk about my experience or my customer's experience.

I want to understand how you use it for your customers So it really depends mostly we build e-commerce stores, right?

So we build let's say a vitamin shop or maybe a You know a store that sells cooters or a store that sells You know Supplements for women.

Let's say so we use it in terms of like we create the ads We try to understand the audience first who's gonna be the audience and we try to customize it Through the through your platform.

That's how we usually do it What do you mean by the you mean by you try to customize it?

Like we try to set up the audience on your system We try to set up where do you want it?

Where do we where do we want our Like customers to see the ad and so on so forth. I'm sure we're missing some stuff

And I would appreciate if you can give us insights. I wouldn't be willing for us initially, at least with monopoly, to enable our ads, but I need somebody from your team to help us create the ads so they can give us at least leads because we're on ads with you guys probably for six months and I didn't even get one lead out of it.



@4:23 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. I'm just taking notes here. Okay, I'm going to ask you a couple more questions.



@4:36 - Moe Farhat

Yep, go ahead. So you mainly work with e-commerce platforms.



@4:42 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Is the goal, okay, gave me a lot of information so I'm just going to crystallize a few things. When you work with your clients, is the first goal, like is the goal brand awareness leads?

It's mostly the goal is...



@5:00 - Moe Farhat

Um, the goal is to get, to get people to buy from the website.



@5:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Conversions. Okay. The goal is website conversions. And had you tried other platforms in the past? Oh, we do.



@5:17 - Moe Farhat

I mean, we try everything. In terms of like tabula. Any ad.



@5:24 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Oh, yeah.



@5:25 - Moe Farhat

mean, we do. The ad platform, sorry. We have like 50 clients and Google ads. have like 35 clients on Facebook, Instagram.

We've got probably about 25 on TikTok. We have a good amount of customers. we have right now, we have an ad role also.

That really happens with them too. So, yeah. Yeah.



@5:53 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So, how old did your customer base, by the way?



@5:59 - Moe Farhat

How old?



@6:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

How large, how large is your customer base like for our agency or for our customers, your agency customers, how many businesses are you working with at the time?



@6:12 - Moe Farhat

We have like a hundred projects right now. Okay.



@6:18 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Wow, you have big agency. Congrats.



@6:21 - Moe Farhat

Thank you. How do you do that?



@6:23 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

How did you get those clients? Well, we advertise on Google.



@6:27 - Moe Farhat

advertise. We're known in the Shopify industry, basically, or Shopify ecosystem.



@6:37 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So your websites are all made on Shopify? Mostly, yes.



@6:41 - Moe Farhat

I would say probably 80% of this. Okay.



@6:48 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, good to know. After tracking and conversions and pixels and all of that. Okay, so, and when you, in which instances are you working with a client and you decide, okay, we're going to put you through to Bula, to Bula that advertising platform instead of Google or TikTok or Facebook, like, have you tried Google TikTok?



@7:23 - Moe Farhat

We don't usually put our customers only on Tabula, we put it on multiple platforms. Like, we do Google, Instagram, Facebook, and Tabula.



@7:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So, it's like an add-on, it's just an additional platform.



@7:37 - Moe Farhat

Yes. Okay, why do you, it's not, it's not, because Tabula is basically like, it's not, how can I say that, it's not direct to customers.

So, customer goes and search, I go to Tabula and search like they do with Google, right? Tabula is just a platform, it's a distribution platform.

pushes image ads and images and content and to certain websites with high quality websites to just show up there.

It's not necessarily like Facebook where, you know, you have to scroll and you see that ads immediately, you know, it's different.

It's like similar to what I can say, the Google performance max campaign, not the search campaign, because they show on the Google network.

So I'm going to call tabula network. We show on tabula network. Yeah.



@8:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So what's the value in your mind of using tabula as opposed to Facebook? Like, how do you kind of see the value there?

It's more distribution.



@8:45 - Moe Farhat

What do you mean by distribution? Distribution means like, what's the value of tabula? value of tabula showing up on Fox News, on CNN, on

on third party or on third party websites that are high d a or high they have high domain authority high quality and using a certain algorithm if that makes sense or certain filters let's say so what's the value to you and to your customers through that like what does that actually bring you more traffic more visibility and it's a lot more you know more more purchases but that doesn't really happen much okay so if you were to say some of the things that kind of like where tibula felt short is that it's conversions



@10:06 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Have you had any issues other than conversions itself? Have you had anyâ€¦ That's the most important thing.



@10:12 - Moe Farhat

mean, if you advertise something and you don't get conversions, that's the most important thing. At least to me, mean, every other business, right?

I mean, you have to have conversions to be able to keep going, otherwise there's no need to advertise.



@10:29 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

100%. You need sales at the end of the day.



@10:32 - Moe Farhat

Okay.



@10:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Do you have any insight into why there hasn't been any conversions? We honestly played with it a lot.



@10:40 - Moe Farhat

I honestly don't know. I really don't. I could all honest it.



@10:48 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. You didn't get any conversions? Not even one. Okay, let me just see here, and you've used to pull up a bit, okay, and I have how many different kinds have you used with to pull up?



@11:28 - Moe Farhat

How many different clients have you used with to pull up, probably like 10 or so?



@11:35 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Interesting that it... Have you tried any platforms like Book Brain or like MGID, any, like, other names? Not necessarily, no.



@11:55 - Moe Farhat

Okay.



@11:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Any reason for why?



@11:57 - Moe Farhat

you just put I'm not interested in those. think it's a waste of money.



@12:02 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You know, what's a waste of money?



@12:04 - Moe Farhat

I'm not interested in those and I think it's a waste of money to use them.



@12:10 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, why do you think it's a waste of money? I, you know, I have few friends who use them or, you know, people who I know use them and they didn't really get to boo them multiple times and it hasn't worked each time.

Why do you keep trying? I'm not trying.



@12:36 - Moe Farhat

I haven't tried since a long time. Okay, got it. No, we posed our ads probably in November, September, October or November.



@12:47 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, if you were to get some help from the team, what would be most valuable people? Getting conversions. Is there anything that you think, okay, if to look at like reach out to you right now, what would you expect them to say to you in order to help you?



@13:09 - Moe Farhat

Health us create the ads and get them versions.



@13:13 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And is it creating the right copy the right positioning the like what do you think it is or it's just totally up in the air?

Both right copy right position Okay, and why do you think that in using the issue lies in copy and positioning I?



@13:37 - Moe Farhat

Mean we tried from our side, but you guys are experts in your platform. so you know how to get the message right.

I mean You know consulting with somebody who works with the bull every day is different from like us who work on it like every now and then, right?

So you know the ends and as you know all the secrets you know how to drive traffic, know who converts versus who doesn't you know what what?

ACTION ITEM: Note for Taboola team to contact Moe Farhat re: ad creation + conversions help - WATCH

has to exclude, so we don't waste money on ads, all of that. Mm-hmm, yep.



@14:06 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. I will put in a note for someone to reach out to, and I hope they do soon. That is what you're interested in.

Okay. Well, thank you so much, Mel, for your time. really appreciate it. I hope the twins feel better. don't know if you start with that.



@14:35 - Moe Farhat

I appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time, too. If you can have somebody help us, I'm willing to get some customers to see you guys back.

again, the most important thing is we need conversions. Without conversion, it's hard to convince people.



@14:55 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

100%. Okay. I will, I've noted. It's all noted. Thank you so much. So, appreciate it. a good one on the bike.

Bye.
