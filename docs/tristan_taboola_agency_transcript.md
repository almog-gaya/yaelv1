SPEAKERS

Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3

00:00
Operations Manager here at my company. Okay,

S

Speaker 1 00:03
cool. Can you just like for context gathering? How do you guys describe your business?

S

Speaker 2 00:12
Are a marketing content agency?

S

Speaker 1 00:15
Marketing Content Agency, okay, and what is the service? It's like all just content copywriting,
copywriting, okay, cool. And then what kind of customers do you have? Not names, but, like,
just industries?

S

Speaker 2 00:33
Yeah, we kind of, we actually service across all industries. So it can be from, you know, tech to
law to finance,

00:42
wow, okay,

S

Speaker 1 00:44
cool, um, and then customers are on retainer, or is it project based? Like, how does that work?

S

Speaker 2 00:52
Both. So we have some that are on a, you know, rolling account, and then some are just project
based, okay, cool. All right. And then,

S

Speaker 1 01:06
okay, how do you guys measure performance? Like, is it like, are you not? Sorry, that was a
weird question. I more so meant, do you is part of your model, like, a success, like, based on
performance, or it's just like a flat rate.

01:24
Flat Rate. Okay,

01:28
cool, okay, um, okay,

S

Speaker 1 01:32
so when you work with a client, I'm assuming, do I still use Taboola? We do, yeah, you do? You
currently use Taboola? Okay, when you think of a customer who you're going to then use
Taboola for, like, what is the thought process? Like, why? What motivates you to realize, okay,
we're going to use Taboola as part of the solution, as opposed to something else. Or, do your
customers ask for it?

S

Speaker 2 01:59
We don't use Taboola with our customers. Actually, it's we use it personally for our company.
Oh,

02:04
really. Okay,

02:07
so what is why

S

Speaker 2 02:10
we use it for exposure, just to get our content out,

02:18
our personal content out,

S

Speaker 1 02:21
and why do you use, like other native advertising platforms,

S

Speaker 2 02:26
you guys are the first that we've really dug into. So we're hoping to keep using you guys as
long as everything goes well, okay,

S

Speaker 1 02:34
um, so it's purely for exposure and awareness, not like conversions.

02:42
I mean, we hope for conversions,

02:46
for people to see our work, and then, you know, reach out to us

S

Speaker 1 02:50
for their own needs. Okay, where else do you advertise on?

02:56
Currently, just Taboola.

S

Speaker 1 02:59
You don't advertise in any other, any other platform period,

03:03
yep, just Taboola. Oh, my God, okay.

S

Speaker 1 03:10
Um, okay, when did you start using Taboola?

S

Speaker 2 03:15
We started using Taboola. I think about six to eight months ago, okay?

03:25
And why did you choose?

S

Speaker 2 03:26
Like, I just want to make sure these answers are private, right? Like, they're going to be used
for your company, but they won't be spread publicly in any way. No,

S

Speaker 1 03:35
no, and I'm not even going to be sharing them with Taboola. Like, this is completely

03:39
anonymous. Is this for just

03:41
so I'm working with the marketing

S

Speaker 1 03:45

team. I give them insights into why their customers buy and don't buy. Their marketing team,
as I'm sure you have not really spoken to anyone from marketing, yeah, so they're like, kind of
detached from the customer, and they to improve the messaging, improve the way they're
thinking about their customer. They're getting a third party like me to provide them with
insights into, you know, anecdotally, what are you sharing with me that they need to be aware
of? But you're not the only person I'm speaking to like I'm speaking to 20 other people. Okay?
Totally anonymous, yeah. Um, they do. They will know that I did speak to you, but they won't
know which information you shared with

S

Speaker 2 04:27
me. Then you'll just send the gift cards my email or, yeah,

04:31
yeah, just your email.

04:34
Okay, perfect. Um,

S

Speaker 1 04:37
okay, but so why did you choose Taboola as opposed to like Facebook, Google, like LinkedIn,
like,

S

Speaker 2 04:48
Yeah, we tried actually all of those, and we didn't see great success with them. We tried paid
on Facebook, we tried paid on LinkedIn, and. Uh, some Google ads, and we got more people
coming to our website from Taboola than we did for the same amount of money on those
platforms. Okay? Ish, I mean, we were using, different budgets at the time, but relatively
speaking, we saw a better performance with Taboola. Okay,

S

Speaker 1 05:28
and has that led to revenue like has it led to leads

05:35
through Taboola? I

S

Speaker 2 05:38
think we've had one or two leads, but it has led to our company's page being more prevalent
on Google, I believe. So that's the reason we see value on it. Okay,

S

Speaker 1 05:58
are you reaching like a specific niche and that by me, that might be the reason, or No,

S

Speaker 2 06:05
I don't know. It's relative to the sense that we're promoting blog articles just for context, and
people look at the blog articles and then they can grow our website, which generates traffic.
And so it's not like we're like advertising our services point blank. We're kind of just writing blog
posts on why our why our services work in a way. And I think maybe that's resonating. I'm not
sure exactly, okay,

S

Speaker 1 06:40
and are you the person who is managing it?

06:46
Yes, okay,

S

Speaker 1 06:48
how is it going? Like setting it up on Taboola? Have you had any challenges?

S

Speaker 2 06:56
Yeah, in the beginning, we had some challenges with just thinking we had it all set up correctly,
and then realizing we didn't. And then I'm working with the Taboola support right now, actually,
on just discrepancy of users we're seeing for clicks versus what's coming into our website. But
overall, I mean, we're happy with the

S

Speaker 1 07:20
with the platform. Sorry, can you elaborate on what you mean by, you know, trying to figure
out what you're seeing versus what's coming to the site. Yeah,

S

Speaker 2 07:29
so we're trying to figure out where we have a we have a we have a software that is able to
track where users are coming from, and to Bula is saying one number that were, let's say it's
2000 that are clicking on our blogs that should bring them to our website. And there's the
advertising campaign that we have says we have, you know, 2000 clicks. And then on the
website, it's only saying that we're getting 1400

07:59
user, you know,

S

Speaker 2 08:02
people coming in from Taboola, so I'm just in the process of trying to figure out why those
numbers are different. Not sure if there is an error. But, you know, I just had my first email
conversation yesterday, so early stages of figuring that out. Okay, got you

08:19
so it's like tracking, tracking issues

08:21
exactly, Okay,

S

Speaker 1 08:27
anything else in terms of getting things set up and like figuring out the platform and making it
work,

08:34
no, everything else is pretty straightforward. Okay? I

08:46
Okay, any feedback?

S

Speaker 2 08:52
No. I mean, you guys have been great with response times and working it out. I

08:58
think everything's been good. Just

S

Speaker 1 09:01
