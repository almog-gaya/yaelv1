Consider them a media partner that we would activate with. Okay, cool, right now I'm just like,
I'm a third party working with the marketing team to get some feedback into how you use the
product, where we can improve

00:18
and just like, be an open mind. Just listen to you and how you, like, consider it for your clients.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions, and we're like, as a way of saying thank you, we're
offering an Amazon gift card, $50 I know that's like, nowhere near like what you bill,

00:35
but yeah, would you mind? Yeah, that's fine. I don't. Yeah, that's fine. I mean, I've got, yeah,
like 510, minutes. Okay, Amazon, cards, not necessary at all. Okay, thank you.

00:47
So, firstly, how do you guys position yourselves?

00:52
So we primarily use

00:55
Taboola to position some of the original content that's right for our client. Sorry. I mean, like, as
a company, as an agency, like, are you guys a marketing agency, digital advertising? How do
you

01:08
we're digital marketing. We cover everything from content creation and editing to media
buying. So we're full service digital agency, okay,

01:19
full service digital marketing agency, okay,

01:24
and who are your clients?

01:29
We work with a lot of local businesses.

01:33
I don't know if I feel the need to know, like kind of rattle off the client list. No, you don't need to.
And your serve and your your like business model? Is it retainer? Is it project based? Is it based
off of like success? How do you guys what's your offer?

01:51
It really depends on the engagement with the client and their services and products that they
saw were pretty flexible in terms of those sorts of arrangements. So we've got a couple of
different ones. It's not a standard that we put out there. Okay? And you Okay,

02:07
cool. Um, okay, so tell me a bit about in which instances you decide to use Taboola.

02:15
What are the cases? Yeah, for for promoting original content that we we write so we write
articles on like local businesses, and we also write some articles on use cases of products for
our clients, okay? And in those instances, we'll use Taboola to advertise those pieces of content
and native placements, okay?

02:47
And what's the primary objective? Is it like brand awareness? Is it lead gen? What are the what
are the goals? Yeah, it'd be brand awareness. Okay?

02:59
And how do you measure that

03:03
click through rate and cost per click and CPM,

03:10
and also any sort of like site side engagement with content beyond the landing page?

03:19
Okay,

03:22
okay, cool. Um, and is this for like, you know, any This is? And then, do you, sorry, promote
these articles on all other kind of platforms, or you just, this is specifically when you write a
original piece of content, you're thinking of Taboola.

03:43
No more multi channel platform for the promotion of this content beyond Taboola. Okay, and
why would you use Taboola? Like, what's the

03:55
what is the like thought Pro, is Taboola gonna bring a specific type of traffic is going to do
anything different, like, what is the how do you think about Taboola in this we think of it as
access to open web for source promotion or for content promotion, a lot of the other channels,
you know what we would do that for are going to be social channels. So this is the platform
we'll use to promote on open web. What do you mean? What does that mean, specifically in
terms of the traffic that you're going

04:29
to be bringing it's really a wider reach than just the social platforms that we might be using. So,
you know, people are open to explore content in all sorts of environments.

04:46

04:46
So social being one of them, and then also just open web, you know, they're reading articles,
and they see other similarly content themed options to explore, or stuff that's perhaps targeted
to them.

05:00
And from an audience perspective, okay, do you do any like use Taboola to like target specific
niches, or it's mainly just for this purpose of brand awareness to the open web.

05:14
We will use content and audience targeting through Taboola to hone in, you know, the
objectives of our campaign. But is that? How important is that to you?

05:27
It's helpful, like, if I had to put it on a scale, it's like a it's like a five out of 10. It's not the best
thing ever. It's not the worst thing ever. It's a helpful tool. You know, sometimes that targeting
is nice, sometimes it's,

05:42
you know, not necessary as well, to kind of get that pulse on how content performs, just to
general market. Okay, so the main objective is, like, you're kind of just sent, pushing this
content out to, like, the general open market for brand awareness, not like bottom of the
funnel, like, really precise targeting. It's more just broader and more traffic.

06:06
Yeah, that'd be well put, okay,

06:09
um,

06:10
how if you were to like, describe like to bull as value proposition and its value that it brings to
you? How would you describe it?

06:22

06:22
It it's like I said, pretty much a regurgitation of that last kind of summary that you provided. It's
a value prop is that it allows us to promote content through paid channels to the open web and
target when necessary. So I don't know if that's what you're looking for, sure that's I'm not
looking for anything as specific. That was very helpful.

06:50
And then how I actually didn't ask this before. How long have you been using Taboola for

06:57
me? Personally, two years in a month.

07:01
I'm not sure that's when I started at this agency, okay? I think before, they may have been
running with Taboola for like a year, so maybe three years total at the agency level, okay? And
were there any like, I guess, you know, unmet expectations, so things that you were your, you
hope for, hope to get from the platform and the results that you don't get,

07:28
not necessarily on the results side of things. Okay, some of the reporting capabilities are pretty
limited inside Taboola, in terms of being able to structure a custom report based on different
dimensions and metrics of of the media that was running, we were pretty, pretty locked into
some standard reports. It'd be nice to kind of,

07:52
you know, see reporting, or rather, curate reporting at different levels to what was needed on
our side. Can you give me an example?

08:02
Yeah, like, I can't create a report across multiple campaigns at the daily level that show ad
level performance.

08:14
So I have to, like, go into each day and pull how those ads did. I can't pull for the last month by
day. How did each one of my ads do?

08:27
Okay,

08:32
okay, got it? Anything else in regards to that?

08:37
That's the most top of mind thing. Okay?

08:42
Any frustrations like when you go into the platform, other than the reporting piece that you just
described, any specific challenges or obstacles that you face when using Taboola?

08:59
I don't think so. Okay,

09:03
um,

09:05
and then,

09:07
okay, so you use you so you guys use many other social, like other paid advertising platforms.
Do you use out brain or any, like direct competitors of Taboola?

09:21
Nope. Okay,

09:24

09:24
do you know why?

09:27
Just haven't explored other channels. We're we're not really,

09:36
like super focused. This is like a tangential strategy of ours. So this isn't like one of the main
kind of strategies for our clients. This is kind of a smaller buy for us, and so we just really
haven't gone very deep into the native space. And you know, like I've said, All in all, we're
pretty happy with Taboola. Okay.

10:01
Any product feedback? This is my last question for you. Any product feedback that you think
would

10:09
add value to you, or, you know, make you want, I don't know, want to recommend it to clients
more.

10:19
I guess you're not recommending it. You're deciding for clients. But

10:25
yeah, yeah,

10:29
I'll be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time in like, the space where you essentially assign all the
targeting, either from an audience or from a content perspective. Okay? I think bolstering that,
making that more readily available could be helpful, maybe more options,

10:49
you know, from either side, if I do recall, there's like, some sort of a weird

10:56
spend, minimum spend threshold that needs to be

11:01
met for campaigns that run on a monthly budget, or something like that. That seemed kind of
odd when I could run dailies at a really low level.

11:14
And, you know, kind of restricting campaigns based on those types of aspects. Seems a little bit
odd, I guess. So it's okay. So there's more flexibility there. They're giving you a monthly
budget, a monthly minimum threshold, as opposed to a daily

11:36
Well, you have the option. You can do either, and when you select monthly

11:42
there's like a minimum monthly budget that needs to be met to run the campaign. But I think
alternately, I could run and that's like $300 or something, and I could run a daily campaign. I
could run a campaign on a daily budget for like $2 and it's no different. So why don't you just
pick the daily

12:03
I do? Oh, some instances. Oh, okay,

12:08
I'm just providing the feedback. Yeah, it seems odd that there's the men cap on the right fleet
budget. Okay, interesting. I will

12:18
report that.

12:20

Cool. Okay. Well, thank you so much, Ben. I really appreciate it. What is your do? I have your
email here? No, I don't have your email. I'd love to send you an Amazon gift card.

12:30
No, I really, I don't take gifts. I'm happy to provide the information. And, yeah, thanks for
reaching out, though. Okay, thanks, Ben. Take care.

12:41
You too, bye, bye, bye.
