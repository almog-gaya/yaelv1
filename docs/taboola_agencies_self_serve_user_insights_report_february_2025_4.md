Leads/Conversions (60%)

people ﬁlling out the lead form.”

more leads and conversions.”

purpose.’

Trafﬁc (20%)
“We were measuring success purely based on volume of trafﬁc”
“We use it for article placement to drive trafﬁc to blogs and articles, primarily from an
SEO perspective.”
“We promote original content that we write and use Taboola to advertise those pieces of
content in native places. We use Taboola for niche targeting to drive trafﬁc to those
pieces of content.”
“We have some clients who come to us and ask us just to ﬁnd ways to get trafﬁc. I think
it’s secretly for investment purposes.”

Awareness (20%)
“Obviously it depends on the client, but we use Taboola when trying to generate
awareness for our clients by targeting speciﬁc audiences on speciﬁc sites and platforms.
The main focus is awareness.”
“Taboola is best for awareness. That’s what we use it for.”
“We only use it for exposure and awareness. Hopefully it’ll result in sales. But the main

Reach Large Audiences/High Trafﬁc Volume (33%)
“Taboola drives a lot of trafﬁc because of the access to a massive market. We can get
more scale with Taboola.”
“It reaches audiences in a wide variety of places allowing us to scale up a campaign. With
Taboola, we don’t have to go to all these places individually and reach all of them with
the same campaign.’
“Taboola has tons of distribution on Fox news, CNN, 3rd party websites that are high
domain authority which reaches more people and gets more visibility.”

Cheaper Cost of Trafﬁc (33%)
“Taboola has cheap high volume of top of funnel trafﬁc with a low cost per click. I don’t
use it for straight conversions because the quality isn’t as high.”
“It’s a cheaper cost of trafﬁc, making it a good place to promote blog articles and drive
trafﬁc to them. It’s great for retargeting audiences, back link building and onsite SEO.”
“Taboola is a cheap testing ground to get high volumes of trafﬁc and see what users do
on a page.”
“Taboola is way less expensive than Google, Meta, Tiktok and IG. Taboola gets way more
impressions and clicks for fraction of the cost.”

Niche Targeting (27%)
“We can narrow down industry and type of demographic and get really speciﬁc. The
value is that it delivers ads to the speciﬁc audience that the client wants and spending
money getting to the right people. Taboola has relevant ad placements based on those
requirements.’
“Taboola has very speciﬁc targeting. The platform has a lot of opportunities to target
speciﬁc groups.”
“Taboola has really good targeting and categories that other platforms don’t allow for.”
“There are big problems with FB and Google with narrowing down niches in the right
demographics. You can’t get speciﬁc. I love Taboola for this.”

“It was a waste. We didn’t get any leads.”
“It didn’t do anything for us. We couldn’t get it to work.”

Unclear why it’s not working (33%)
“Our team has played with it a lot and with all honesty I don’t know why it’s not working.
Didn’t even get 1 conversion.”
“There’s nothing in particular that I struggled with. I just couldn’t ﬁgure out how to get it
to work.”
“I spent several hours going through the Taboola university learning prior to. I thought I
used the best practices guides. I did use the articles. But didn’t see any leads at all. Zero
conversions.”

Learning Curve (20%)
“Learning the tool is the hardest part. I spent quite a bit of time digging around and
looking for guidance and how to use the rules.”
“User experience was too complex. It was overwhelmingly jarring. It requires a steep
learning curve. I powered through it because I’m desperate. It’s a very overwhelming
experience. Powering through it feels like I’m walking through a storm. For the set up I
was surrounded by a thousand options and wasn’t sure what I was doing. I was
guesstimating and I probably got the terms wrong.”

Compliance Review Process (1 person)
“The automatic review process blocks things by default which would otherwise not be
removed. They cancel things in the middle of campaigns. The compliance review process
is inefﬁcient. If it’s an AI based tool, it should be an instantaneous review. When I submit
ads (ex: one sentence and one image for the ad. Puts it in 5 different ad variances.) 3 get
approved, 2 don’t. When you update the 2 rejected images, those get approved. 4 get
approved and then they reject 4. This is very annoying because clients sign off on it and
it’s taken from their websites.”

Tag Management/Pixels (1 person)
“It said everything was ﬁne and got the green check marks, but wasn’t seeing any of the
pixels ﬁring that they’ve been hit. There was a lot of back and forth with the tech team.
They needed to do something that wasn’t actually in the instructions (something they
needed to ﬁgure out themselves). The account kept getting blocked and the ads weren’t
being delivered for 2 weeks.”

“Nothing was unexpected.”
“I have some feedback but it was exactly what I expected.”

Poor quality (bot) trafﬁc (33%)
“We got leads - but they were really really really bad. People entered fake stuff. They
entered vulgar information in the form ﬁelds. It really spooked out our client. If there were
few leads but the leads that came in were stronger, it would’ve been received much
better.”
“We use lucky orange to see scrollability. There was high evidence of bot trafﬁc. It
recorded lots of clicks with no activity or engagement on the site.”
“There is way too much bot trafﬁc. There are sites with low views and high clicks. It means
there’s weird stuff going on in terms of fraud.”
“I want some publishers' sites blocked because they have really bad trafﬁc, and it’s
wasting our spend.”
“I expected the quality of the trafﬁc to be better.”

No leads / conversions (27%)
“I thought after spending $400 there would be leads. The phone didn’t ring once. It’s
disheartening.”
“I was expecting to convert at a 1:1 ROAS. I was expecting to see results as soon as being
on high quality domains. My plan was to spend $5000 but we didn’t get a single lead
after spending $658. I’m a ﬁerce protector of my clients’ spend.”
“We’ve been with Taboola for 6 months and didn’t even get 1 lead. Tried it with 10 different
clients and it didn’t work.”
“It was a complete waste because we didn’t get any sales.”
“I realized it’s much more of an awareness play, not for conversions.”

Conversion tracking (1 person)
“I thought setting up tracking for conversions would be easier. It didn’t work right and
was confusing to do. We are used to complex methods of setting up tracking which
might haven’t been the reason”

Filter out bot trafﬁc (40%)
“I want to know how to avoid junk leads. Speciﬁc guidance on how to not have junk leads.
Or, just not have the junk leads at all.”
“I’ve been working in ad tech for 15 years. The amount of bot trafﬁc that exists is really
high. They need to do a better job of ﬁltering out bot trafﬁc.”
“I want the option to have a black list campaign and a white list to ﬁlter to know which is
good and which isn’t. I don’t want bad trafﬁc.”
“I want the ability to block sites and not have bad bot trafﬁc.”
“There are lots of garbage sites that pop up on Taboola. The more control we have, the
better. Would love to use Taboola more extensively, but there isn’t enough control and
optionality.”

Guidance on what gets leads (33%)
“We need expert guidance on what copy and positioning actually works to get leads. If
we can start getting conversions, we will use this for all our customers. We have over 100.”
“I’d love a short video that explains: ‘If you’re doing lead gen, here is what you have to do.’”
“If there was guidance in terms of ad budget and leads it would’ve been helpful. For
example, if it said ‘if your goal is to generate X leads in X time frame, we suggest X
budget.’ this would be valuable.”
“Maybe I didn’t go through the tutorials enough, but if there was clear ‘how to rules’ on
how to make me more proﬁtable, I would leverage the platform better.”
“I’m confused about the different display networks and which ones will actually get
clients leads.”

Adding emails to the account (1 person)
“I have to send an email to team members to add people to the account. It was hard to
add my boss and coworkers to see the billing. It would be great if this wasn’t an issue.”

© Decode Insights Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Inconsistent invoicing (1 person)
“I want to be charged when a campaign stops. The invoicing was inconsistent. I had a
charge for November that went into December. It charged on the 11th of the month not
the 1st of the month. Makes it messy for expense reports for client billing.”

© Decode Insights Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Enhanced Reporting (1 person)
“The reporting capabilities are limited. Right now I have to go into each day and pull how
the ads did each did. I want to pull a report month and see how the ads did each day. I
want a report across multiple campaigns daily, that show ad level performance.”

© Decode Insights Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Offer Testing Credit (1 person)
“I recommend giving a $1000 credit for a $1000 in spend to test the platform. Google and
Meta does this.”

© Decode Insights Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Improved Targeting (1 person)
“If Taboola can improve the targeting piece, that would be a competitive differentiator.
Right now, I can’t target combinations of segments and deep targeting. Very few people
are offering that. The more niche we need to go, the more we go away from Taboola. This
is why we use Taboola for more brand awareness campaigns”

Marketing Idea
“If Taboola has a list of preferred services providers that they would
recommend as ‘Taboola Certiﬁed Experts”, businesses can then promote it,
and it by extension promotes Taboola.” - Logan

Takeaways
●
●
●
●
●

Agencies prioritize leads and conversions – Agencies need and are expecting
high-quality leads.
Trafﬁc quality is a major concern – Agencies report excessive bot trafﬁc and
demand better ﬁltering and control.
Many struggle to get results – Even experienced users ﬁnd it unclear why
campaigns fail, highlighting the need for better guidance.
Platform complexity hinders adoption – A steep learning curve and
confusing setup process create friction for new users.
Clearer conversion strategies are needed – Agencies want actionable
insights on ad setup, budgeting, and targeting to drive ROI.

Addressing these gaps will improve agency retention and long-term adoption.
