do lasik surgeons really get LASIK on their own eyes? I try to use like, clickbaity stuff, because
obviously, like, with the native advertising, it's being stuck in Yahoo Finance and websites like
that, right? So what we'll do is we'll use that as, like, cheap top of the funnel traffic to drive two
blogs, I find, as long as like, the quality is good and the headlines not like, alligator attack
Florida, and then you, like, lead them to a cataract landing page, like, and you're trying to trick
them, that's like, not cool. But if like, your headline actually matches the text, then your on
page metrics should be pretty good. And people should stay on the site, and then that'll like,
help our metrics. But like how I use it. Like Johnson and Johnson, they make lenses for eyeballs,
right? And so I go to Johnson and Johnson, and I show them, hey, in 2024 best
cataractsurgence.com had 500,000 people, ages 65 and above visit the website. Do you want
to give us a million dollars to get your lenses in front of those people for retargeting purposes?
They say yes, so I use it like one to try to lift up the rising tide will lift all of the boats. So I try to
use it like from an SEO perspective, to drive traffic to certain articles that I'm trying to get
ranked. And I'll use that as part of the strategy, as well as some of the backlink building, as well
as, like, some of the on site SEO tactics. And then I'll use it specifically for this business model
to create traffic and then raise

01:43
go to the market to get more funding, right? Because then

S

Speaker 1 01:46

if I get a million dollars from Johnson and Johnson, well, what do I do with it? I pocket some of it,
and then I also pump it back into traffic. And then now I have a bigger snowball. And then I go
back to them and I say, Hey, you gave us a million when we have 500,000 people to our
website. Now we have a million people to our website. We need 2 million, right? So it's that
snowball effect, and then we use it for, like, mostly all the ad accounts or companies. Actually,
every single one in our Taboola account is all companies that I own. So we're not really using it
that much for, like, client facing, because, Oh, we did have, we did use it for a LASIK clinic, and
they were getting pretty good conversions off of it actually very surprising. But I don't use it like
based on, like, straight conversions, because I feel like the quality of traffic that are clicking
through through Taboola, which is why, like, the cost per clicks much cheaper there than on
Google or Facebook, right? I don't find the traffic is high quality, but it's great for retargeting
audiences. It's great if you think they allow the ability to upload lists to it. So with Zoom info
seamless, AI, whatever, wherever you're buying lists, that's a good option too, to to get content
in front of them if you're uploading your list. But I haven't done that in a bit. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 03:06
so it's predominantly for just volume of traffic.

03:12
Cheap, good,

S

Speaker 1 03:14
cheap, cheap, good traffic. Like, yeah, I find it good for like building audiences and for driving
traffic to a website. And, you know, it's a very high volume. It's not like Google, Google clicks
that someone's searching online and you're getting your lace AT Clinic in front of them. It's like
you're putting an article about how much money you lose by renewing contacts versus

03:43
getting LASIK right.

S

Speaker 2 03:46
So, is it like? So you were to, you were, like, had an E commerce, not, okay, that's a bad
example. Um, is it like, the fact that you've, like, it's a Lasik eye surgery article. Does that have
anything to do with the fact, like, is it this specific use case that is a niche market or a niche
topic, or not at

S

Speaker 3 04:09
all play with, like, the E commerce like example, just to, like, throw a wrench in it, but it would

be like,

S

Speaker 1 04:17
you know, one of our E commerce brands, uh, Lake, easy, Lake, easy.com. Makes a product for
like that connects to docs, and it has, like a little cup holder and stuff. It's like a seat too, that
it'll connect to your doc and you can sit, and it turns your dock into, like a swim up bar, right?
And so, like, you know, I would place that on Taboola, and target people who dock owners or
boat owners with this ad saying, like, the hottest product of the summer, right? And then like,
from there we're gonna get like, based on the cost per click, we're gonna get a bunch of.
Traffic. Let's say we get 100,000 people. Well, now it's pretty cheap to re target those people
on Facebook, Instagram and all of that, and then now from there, we push them further down
the funnel. So it's like just starting. They used Taboola like to start really wide with an audience,
and then start narrowing and using other channels to start segmenting that audience down.

S

Speaker 2 05:21
Okay, makes complete sense. Okay, so just like, volume, like, it's just like a ton of traffic for
like, top of the funnel, okay, I

05:31
think so at

S

Speaker 1 05:32
least like, how we're using it, like, right now, I'm sure there's other like options in Taboola. Like,

S

Speaker 3 05:39
yeah, I'm sure there's a lot to Taboola that I am not doing right. When

S

Speaker 2 05:44
you mentioned click bait stuff, what did you mean by that?

S

Speaker 3 05:49
Yeah, I mean click bait would be all the

S

Speaker 1 05:55

you know, we have to get people's attention, at least we're in this there's two different
philosophies like to it, right? We're one. We're all in a noisy, noisy world, and you have to do
something to stand out. Yep, the second approach to that would be, you're trying to stand out
by doing cheesy shit, and it's not working, you know, add more value and your marketing will
work better, right? So if like that first approach of like in a noisy room, the click baity term
would be, I basically, when I see where Taboola is specifically placing advertisements, they
place it like, natively, banner ads, all sorts of stuff. It's typically like we're using it for, like,
Article placement to drive to blogs. It it's based on a picture and a headline. So the headline
has to capture that audience, and that's what I mean by like, click baity. You need to be kind of
controversial when someone's scrolling like, on Yahoo Finance, specifically, it's like, you know,
Yahoo Finance, like, I'll just look at a Taboola ad, right? Like, when someone's scrolling down
here and we see news, news ad right, with no description on it, Florida, the list of the top 10
financial advisor firms is out. Like, that's a click baity headline, they should have used the
number 10 instead of, oh, of the top they didn't even have 10, but they should use a number,
but, like, they could have grabbed my attention a little bit more, right? And that's what I'm
trying to do with the headlines. So, like, that's what I need. That's what I mean by clickbaity,
two insane cards now charging 0% like, two insane cards now, like, that's pretty powerful
language, right? That's gonna make me, like, click More than two credit cards that are good for
you right now, right?

08:10
Okay, yeah, it makes sense

S

Speaker 2 08:14
anywhere. Okay, I know you don't use the platform, okay? I think I'm, I think I'm solid on, like,
understanding how you're using the platform and why you use it, I know you haven't used it in
a while, or like, you're not actively using it, or like, really are, I mean, you are actively using it,
but you're not literally. Was there anything that, like, when you previously started using
Taboola, anything that you expected that it would do that it didn't do, or vice versa.

08:48
Like thing unexpected,

08:58
not really. Okay.

09:04
No, I guess not. I wish the quality of traffic

09:08
was better.

09:12
I think I was expecting the quality

S

Speaker 3 09:13
of traffic to be probably better, but then when you look at the cost,

09:21
think it makes sense.

09:23
Okay, I don't even know what.

09:26
What do you mean by higher quality traffic?

09:30
I mean, it's looking at the indicators of

S

Speaker 1 09:35
what traffic we drive from Taboola to like a blog, or the benefits of LASIK surgery, right? Or why
you should have the lake easy bar. It tends to have, like, a higher bounce rate and not as much
time on site from those users visiting which is indicating that, like, maybe they're not finding
what they want, which is why I kind of started the conversation with you don't. Want to just put,
like, an alligator attacks child at Disney headline that's click baity that people will probably click
and then drive them to a LASIK article and try to, like, fool them that way, right? Probably that's
going to, like, have a quality score issue in Taboola and you're going to your ad is going to get,
like, not placed as much, but additionally, like, it's not right to the user, and it's going to, like,
send negative indicators to Google that like, Hey, you're driving spammy traffic to a website,
and it could negatively impact the organic rankings of that page, which, again, I'm using it to
try to increase those indicators, right? Yeah, 100%

S

Speaker 2 10:51
okay, yeah, anything like other than that, is there any challenge that you've had when trying to
use the platform like with targeting, with like, measuring, tracking.

S

Speaker 3 11:09
No, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, I guess we've run into hiccups with just add approval,
probably in the medical space. Okay, you know that's not unexpected, okay, considering
healthcare marketing and all that, okay, okay,

S

Speaker 2 11:31
I don't think I have any other questions. This is really helpful.

11:35
Okay, that's easy.

S

Speaker 2 11:39
People are like, I'm so hesitant to do have these conversations. And I'm like, it's like, it's not a
painful process. I don't know, you're hesitant. People are hesitant. They're like, I don't want to
talk to you. I'm like, Why do you know who wouldn't want to talk to me? Yeah,

11:56
it's very true. I mean, I think it's like, I

12:00
don't know. I normally don't take these. I get a million of them,

S

Speaker 1 12:04
but I guess the $50 whatever you offered, and then plus, like, I haven't been using Taboola, so
this forced me. I haven't logged in to bull in at least a year, and I've spent, let's see,

S

Speaker 3 12:20
lifetime I make sure, come on follow up. I.
