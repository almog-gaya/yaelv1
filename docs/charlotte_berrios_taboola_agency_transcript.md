So, thank you.



@0:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And I'm like literally hunched over here. Okay. I don't want too much of your time and I think we can like make this relatively kind of fast.

First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to have this conversation. Can you just give me some context?

Are you a marketing agency?



@0:25 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

Yes, I work for a marketing agency and what I'm advertising and tabula is for my personal injury. Sorry, my brother's dog is yapping in the background.

Let me explain that real quick. Okay. Let me go on the background.



@0:49 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So I'm going to just kind of ask you some questions and we can just follow. So what kind of marketing agency is it?

Like how would you describe it?



@0:58 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

We're a full service marketing agency.



@2:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

customers do you work with?



@2:02 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

My main customers, they're personal injury attorneys, but I also had car dealerships, liquor stores, events, political, political candidates. even had one time a shop.

had all types of clients.



@2:23 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Wow, amazing. cool. And how do you price a flat fee? it a retainer? it project-based? do you do that?



@2:32 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

I mean, I'm not the one that negotiates that. just end a digital marketer, but I assume it's a retainer-based.



@2:45 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, but I don't handle that aspect.



@2:48 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

I just create the ads. I just handle the digital marketing side of all my clients.



@2:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so when you actually think about to For what kind of cases do you use the platform?



@3:07 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

So, well, my client handles accidents, car accidents, motorcycle accidents. So those types of cases I'm trying to get with tabula.

Okay, why tabula? We just wanted to try something new because we're basically everywhere. So we just wanted to see what we could get in tabula.



@3:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Are you trying a brain or do you consider other platforms? What was your decision-making process?



@3:41 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

It was basically my boss was like, okay, check this platform out. She explained to me what it was, and she said create a campaign.

And I did. So basically that was, she actually was the one that founded and told me to basically try.

it out, and I've been trying it, I would say, for the past three months. Okay.



@4:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

How has it been going?



@4:06 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

So far, surprisingly, well, we have our conversions on different tiers, for us, call would be the lower tier, because it's the easiest.

You can call a lawyer, but not necessarily, it could turn into a case, but a chat and a form fill would be more intent and more valuable lead.

We've gotten quite a few conversions, but most of them have been calls, but we're happy with that because the cost per lead has been lower compared to other platforms that we're advertising on, but it's been good.

We're not putting too much of our budget in tabula yet, so it's been okay with us. So you're just in the testing stage.



@5:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yes.



@5:01 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

Okay.



@5:09 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. What would you say, like, other than it's, like, lower cost per lead compared to other platforms, would you say is, like, the main value that Tabula actually brings?



@5:21 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

I would say, as of now, that would be, that would be it because that's, like, our main goal is just to get leads.

So, we're getting them at a low cost, so that's all we want.



@5:37 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Okay. And you are managing Tabula, like, there's no one else really using it. Okay. how is it going, like, onboarding onto the product and using it, like, how is that?

ACTION ITEM: Update Tabula articles: switch out winter-based content for upcoming season - WATCH

It was fine.



@5:56 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

And once you use different platforms, there are all kind of things. obviously some have like little differences, but it was fine.

I do have to switch out my articles because all of them are like winter-based and we're like easing out of that soon.

But I thought it was it was simple to launch the campaigns and everything.



@6:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, any challenges that you kind of want wish were easier?



@6:24 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

No, I thought it was it was fairly straightforward. I didn't have any issues.



@6:29 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Okay, other than cost per click, sorry, cost per lead, any other like main differences and like how does tibula compare to the platform?

Like what purpose are you thinking of? You have all these different platforms for you have all these platforms for marketing and advertising like Facebook and TikTok and Google.

How does tibula compared to those ones. how do you think about how it's positioned, I guess?



@7:07 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

I mean, it's too early for me to tell at the moment because I've only been using it for three months and I really, out of my whole entire budget, is I've very, very small amount that I'm spending, I'm spending only $1,000 per campaign and compared to my other campaigns, that's super low.

So I really haven't invested enough to really make a comparison, but it was a surprise for us because we didn't know actually that we were going to get very much leads, not leads with conversions, and it was very surprising that we did.

So that's why we've kept it. Well, okay, great.



@7:52 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And have you heard of like other native advertising platforms like Outbrain or MGID? No, and I haven't used those.

Okay. Okay, amazing. That's like really, really good to hear. Are you like, how was your targeting with the platform?



@8:19 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

It's all legal, legal terms, because my client is a lawyer. Um, so yeah, everything is legal terms. I can't tell you exactly what I use, but I'm assuming it's all related to legal stuff.

Okay.



@8:39 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. I'm more so mean though, like the functionality of the filtering, like using the filters to target.



@8:48 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

It was fine. Um, again, like once you use like so many different platforms, they'll look like, okay.



@8:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Um, any, I know it's early, like you've only used this for three months, like any product feedback that you have that would make your life easier, any tips, any communication from Tumbula to you that would be valuable.



@9:15 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

I mean, the only thing I would say that was different was that I couldn't add, um, people to account like I had to like send an email and like somebody had to add them, that would be my only feedback, be able to add all my team members into not have to send an email to add the person to my account, that would be my only feedback.



@9:40 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so you'd want more people to add in like visibility for your clients?



@9:44 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

Man, it'd be like an easier process like I had to like for me to add my boss so she and add another co-worker so she can see the billing aspect of it.

had to like send an email to be able to add that person like I couldn't just like invite the person myself.

Okay, like our platforms that you go in and you just invite whoever you want and assign whatever you want it to be admin or view or whatever, like I just want to do that myself.



@10:15 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, yeah, basically sense. Yeah, it's like in a Google sheet, you can just add a person.



@10:24 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

Yeah, you have to like ask, like send an email and then the person has a response back and you're like, want to have the person that gets just takes too long.

Okay.



@10:36 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, this is super helpful. Thank you so much. I don't know if you don't have any other questions. Okay.

Thank you. And I hope everything goes well with using to blend. It will be successful for you and your client.



@10:51 - Charlotte Berrios (On Target Media)

you.



@10:52 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, thank you.
