And our media buyers are discussing on all the categories and they're finding winning campaign, winning ads, and they're making, they're just start testing or something.

When they get the winning campaign, then we are going to like scaling on those particular campaigns. Okay.



@14:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so you, and then you use TABULA for each of these platforms.



@14:13 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah. Also, TABULA, like in DC, every business, TABULA is leading a native network. Most of the, most of the, we do what, what did you say to bull leads, what network?

Leads, leads, leads, are leading short something. In my head, there is lots of, lots of like native networks, like our brain, news break, and TABULA is leading platform.

Leading for what? Leading for AFD, like AdSense for domain. Okay, we are publishing AdSense for domain. Okay, this is, this, this, this is called AFD and, okay, hardstock or something.

For such arbiters, okay.



@15:02 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, sorry, but I'm not understanding what is the leading. So you say you compare tabula to outbrain. How is tabula leading in what way?



@15:12 - Rakibul Islam

Because most of our partners, most of our competitors, most of our like, restay for business are like making like making campaign on tabula.

We are like, we are seeing their ads on publisher inventory, like publisher website. We are getting like spy tool and we have a disaster team.

And after that, we get the things that tabula is leading platform where we compare like outbrain and other native networks.

And what way is it?



@15:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What does success look like with tabula? Like why is it the leading platform? has the most traffic, it has the most, what is it best at?



@15:52 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, they have like most traffic, most inventory or something there. We can like target their Interested people and we get the relevant person from their ads, okay?

Loads of like other networks have like both topics or something or systematic traffic or something. When we run ads on those platforms, we get loads or something, okay?

So it's more targeted?



@16:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, more targeted. And more niche? What else?



@16:25 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, like something, they are like, they are just making good value from other networks. Yeah, we are getting like a return on investment, good return on investment from tabula, okay?

So like if we run like something $100 per day, then we are getting like $150 in detail or $200 or something.

In point of ROI, tabula is like a stable network.



@17:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so the best ROI, is you getting comfortable with that? Yeah, yeah. So for what exactly the type of businesses and the type of ads, what is it best for?

Is this best for certain types of industries?



@17:16 - Rakibul Islam

Yes, certain types of e-commerce deals, e-commerce, e-commerce so fast and employment, who people which are- Yeah, it's like who are just starting jobs or something?

So we connect advertiser to job seekers by tabulars, tabular networks by through our offer or something.



@17:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, okay, got it. Any issues with tabular? Yeah, in personal account, we didn't get like low



@18:00 - Rakibul Islam

So, publisher block sites from Google, okay? Google are providing us a list of blocking sites or publisher, they have like detected, but I can block from my account level, okay?

When I want to run campaign.



@18:17 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You want to block sites?



@18:19 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, I want some publishers in block from my account site, account level. So, I don't wanna run like, there is loads of like 1000 of publishers, they are like making like, they are just making not good work.

So, we're getting loads when our ads are one of those publishers. Google also have like a list of publisher.

So, I wanna block, but I can't from my settings or something. I have to like, I have to put my blocking publisher in every campaign by manually.

Tabula also provide this blocking level for like, agency account or something network account so in like self-fustered account or not like get the disadvantage or something so this is like a bad way our like 20 to 30 percent revenue or more revenue are like getting lost for this kind of region.

22 percent.



@19:22 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah 20 to 30 percent. 20 to 30 percent of revenue is being lost.



@19:32 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah. Of course not.



@19:34 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah.



@19:35 - Rakibul Islam

Bad publisher side. We are like trying to block from our account. I opened the case and but it's not work or something they didn't like allow to block or this kind of website or something and I have to put all the site by main walling by copy-pasting the URLs public can I think.

Okay.



@19:59 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What is a bad publisher site. it mean bot traffic?



@20:03 - Rakibul Islam

No, no, there is like some inventory like apps, a website, didn't have good traffic or something, just like making an earning type of a content or something self-clicking.

There are these do-sider like taking unlimited users for earning by clicking ads or something, Did you get my point?

Yeah, so there's there are people who you don't want to target on those sites. Yeah, yeah, we don't like those publishers, but we want to block them, okay?

We got on website, we can find out who each site are not making money, okay, for us. So we want to block them.

If we block on those ads, site, those publishers, we will get more revenue and we will like run more ads on this is advantage, okay?

So also, this kind of reason we didn't, our result is not like stable. Okay, we get like 100% ROI and next day we will get, we will see that 30% ROI and that next day we like getting minus, okay, we are getting lost 20% or something.

Why? Wait, is this a different point? Yeah, this is for like, we are like, didn't controlling, we can't control the bear side or something.

If we are like with a witch. Okay, so I am going to like presentation my, so you will get that actual things, why?

Okay, so, okay, in reporting in tabula. So if I like last seven days, if I show you my seven days report from here, so total date, okay, let's see, okay.

So in third of February, we are getting like 64% ROI, okay, our form tabula, okay.



@21:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And second day is 40%.



@22:00 - Rakibul Islam

6 and 51, and 7 of February 33, also like see yesterday we got only 11% so this is not stable and also today is like we are on making loss or something okay so if we get like a blog or like we have like thousands of publishers list so if we are tabulars tabulars, manas, other tabulars, repeat entity, blog, side for our campaign or our account so we will get like we will make like a stable ROI okay so when we see like those campaigns are making loss or something so we gonna pause or we gonna stop that campaign and we have to like we have to like put new ads or something and we have to like blocking those sides or manually by okay we will we will get those sides like if like I am

Yesterday If I scan sites which side are like getting most A PC. Okay, so see this is like a site called Vivo browser filling in English This is like a apps of Vivo or something.

Okay, these sites these sites are like making our laws Okay, this is not good site for us for our business.

Okay, even a blog Okay, if like there is thousands of thousands of sites So if we like making like manually issue laws of work, okay, yep So we're not we're gonna export those sites like from here and we want to like provide it tabula And tabula needs to like block from our account.

Okay, so it should It should be look for us. Okay, so few sites few sites are like making good ROI So these these sites are like making good

ROI, so we want to like target it more ads for those side also, so this this can be make good advantage for us.

So we want to like we want to like serve our ads most of those ads on those sides, so this this is our this is our like best for our traffic, so we can find out from our system.



@24:27 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so the main two issues is that you want to make the lock these bad websites because it's causing you to have bad traffic and it's impacting your return and investment and addition is because of these you can't lock these sites it's causing you to have very inconsistent results and those inconsistent results are impacting your bottom line.



@26:00 - Rakibul Islam

30 to 50,000. Nowadays, I am running like in self account, like only one to two thousand dollar per month or three thousand dollars highest.

So, I am targeting like making just this is also my a testing period because I am not stable by self account.

I am like making a constant result or good result or what I need. So, there is like fluctuate every day.

One day is like 100 percent, the next day is minus 20 percent. So, I need someone who will help me like to like getting these kind of issues or passing like these kind of issues or something.

So, it will increase me to like buzzed or I can like spending more on tabula platform. So, I already talked with like I have only support



@27:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

their site.



@27:01 - Rakibul Islam

So they just they are just telling me that there is no personal manager or something. So in other edition, one of my like friends, he's also running a campaign on Tabula long time.

So we are new here because we are testing Tabula just a couple of months and he just will publish and he have personal manager from Tabula and they're just helping him or for like making campaigns.

They also provide him the top party girls, top categories and others inside. So that's helping him to like make good profit and good spending history and he's just here like making like spending per month, 30 to 50k per month.

Okay, on Tabula, but I 100k? Yeah, 30 to 50k. Oh, okay. So because he get the good returns and he get the good insight from Tabula streams.

highest or something on tabula for this kind of reason and I am waiting one of my friends are calling me that if I like continuously running campaign by tabula so they will knock me and they will assign me a manager or something so I am waiting for that this time okay when I get a manager or personal assistant or something from tabula so me and my team will focus on tabula like strongly like we will focus and we will spend more like 10,000 pounds from starting so this is a simple method if we go to make a consistent good result good ROI so we can go for further okay we can go for more and or something so if I didn't get enough result we didn't get a winning result so we can go for like high amount we are like spending just

regular amount. That's the thing we are getting.



@30:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and you think the major reasons are because of the publisher, bad publisher sites?



@30:09 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, we have to get a better publisher site and we have to put manual, okay, there is loads of 1000,000 bad publishers.

how many we can go for like one by one? So there is taking loads of time. So we have like an immediate solution like we will provide five of those publishers and they just make up load on my account level and for our next campaign, our new campaign, we want to not start being on those sites, okay, this is the thing.



@30:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and it takes too much time to manage and clear up Or Google, like how, or outbrain, how does how does Tibla compare?



@31:00 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, in terms of like compare Facebook is like making us a good choice. We are like we are in suspending our like 95% budget on Facebook because we get like target more targeted person more busy chores and yeah, you get better trap more traffic from Facebook.

Yeah, we Facebook has like the resiliency step. Okay, Facebook results are like look, when we get like winning campaign, those campaign are like making a stable from day one to day long.

We have like three months campaign from Facebook, three months, six months. Also, even we have like on your class long like campaign on Facebook.

So it's giving That's consistent result.



@32:02 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. So, you like Facebook better than Tabula?



@32:07 - Rakibul Islam

Yeah, in some times of when we get like personal manager or something in assistance, we can go like we can make good ROI on Tabula.

So, we believe that because of one of my friends and other competitors are making good ROI from Tabula also.

So, in terms of view, they are just investing their mix on Tabula because they have like they get like something special we didn't get it on personal account.

Also, they get like a network account, network in network account, they get like a $10,000 and one of my like client, he was my client, he have account with 30K, he can spend 30K per month.
