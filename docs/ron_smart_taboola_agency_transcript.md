@1:54 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

insane. crazy.



@1:56 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah.



@1:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Take some of that.



@1:58 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Crazy.



@2:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I'm sorry you guys deal with all that out there.



@2:03 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

It's crazy.



@2:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, I'm not going to get into it because it's like, sometimes I like intentionally block things like I was speaking to my mom, like my whole family is actually in Canada.

But today she's like, yeah, did you hear about this and this? I'm like, no, I did my went to the Dead Sea, I did my half marathon and I haven't looked at the news for like, it's funny because we all just want to live our lives, you know.

Here especially like, you, I'm in a city where people are so present and I think it's like intentional because people like, there's no other way to cope with the situation and people are very like, you feel energy from people because they're so present.



@2:47 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

don't want to be plugged into like the news, but it's a way to cope. Yeah, yeah, no news. I just advertise on it.

Exactly.



@2:58 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

There you go. All right, so I, like I mentioned previously, so I work with Tibula, I'm a third party, I have a business that does customer interviews, and they hired me to understand why you buy and why you don't buy, and then get some feedback on the actual product itself, they will then implement.

So I have a bunch of questions, and I will go through it. It's really a conversation. I'm not actually like reading a script here, but because the conversation is to be taking some notes, and it's like nothing like really confidential, it's all anonymous, like I'm not going to be sharing like Ron from, don't even forgot the name of It's not going to get to put my name on, I'll tell them exactly what their platform right now.

Okay, let's do it. Great. What kind of business do you have?



@3:52 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Well, many businesses, we anything from, we have a fight show. We have a law firm, and the You're a marketing agency.



@4:02 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You're a marketing agency?



@4:04 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Well, we asked one of the people to say, yeah.



@4:08 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

OK, what do you use to rule a four? You're marketing agency.



@4:13 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Generating sales.



@4:15 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

OK, but for your clients or for yourself? No, I don't really take on clients.



@4:21 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So I mean, I do, but we're in a different kind of a unique position. I usually find companies I want to work with and partner with them that I believe in what they're doing or their product.

And then I'll come in and I'll either fund it and do all the marketing and blow it up or that's kind of my own.



@4:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

OK, cool. So you're not a viewer, not an agency.



@4:47 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

I mean, I do do some agency stuff, too. Like I got some local businesses I help. You know, we launched different products.

I help other people launch products. I coach people. I do a lot of stuff. Wow.



@5:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

But one of those, okay, very cool.



@5:02 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

I'm not like the influencer guy that gets on YouTube, so it's like teaching that I don't, but...



@5:08 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You could be, you could be. You got like the personality for it, I think. It'd be fun.



@5:13 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

might do maybe, I don't know. I just, I like to stay low-key. It's just a lot easier. think, you know, I don't know.

Okay.



@5:22 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so what do you do? Like, how do you help these businesses? Tell me about it, tell me about it.



@5:27 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So, you know, I'll find a great offer, and I'll notice that they just aren't getting the traffic, but see something unique that I think I can scale, and I'll come in, and I'll figure out a way to network that person, and eventually have a conversation and see how I can help them, and some things work out, some things don't, and then the things that do work out, we'll throw a budget at, and we'll bring them in, and, you know, we'll take their existing.

offers and create creatives and run bunch of traffic and blow it up.



@6:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So you have a marketing background, I'm assuming, okay, and all forms of marketing, advertising, paid advertising, like...



@6:13 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah, I have a film degree, I've done commercials, done paid media, I can code, I write directly, so it's copied.

I've been doing it for 28 years, so 27 or 28 years. Okay, cool.



@6:28 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What kind of businesses do work with?



@6:30 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

I work with anything from like home services to law firms and everything in between. I don't do a whole lot of like low ticket stuff, mostly high ticket.

Anything with, you know, I mean the lawsuits are great, I mean we're looking at 100,000 plus per deal, right?

So that's good money. We did solar for a long time, we've done finance, we've done... I hate to say it, but we did student loan forgiveness for a little while, which I, that was a program where Obama came in and said that we're going to forgive your loans and your student loans.

Right? they were going to, and basically if you're a teacher or worked in the public sector, it wouldn't, you wouldn't be taxed on that, but later on I found out that a lot of these companies were, you know, touting that, you know, student loan forgiveness gets your loans wiped out, right?

But what they didn't realize was they got taxed on the back end of that forgiveness. So they, now they, they got the loan paid off and then they owe a big lump sum on their taxes that year, and that really screwed lot, and I found out about it.

funny thing is, I'm, I've always been about giving value and helping people, and I found out what these guys were doing, and they owed me.

I was pretty deep in bed with these guys and we started couple other businesses and I had to walk away from it because it ripped the people off.

Oh my god. Yeah, so they they they owed me about a million dollars so I hadn't just walked away.

So yeah, totally sucked. But I couldn't live myself and I couldn't be a part of it because that I mean and later on they I found out that they uh they were indicted so I'm glad I did.

Yeah.



@8:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So not yeah, okay. Crazy life man.



@8:35 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Marketing is crazy.



@8:36 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

a lot of crazy that goes on.



@8:38 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Excuse my friends. Yeah, clearly.



@8:40 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, yeah.



@8:42 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So, yeah, so I've done that. I've worked for good companies in the student debt industry. Solar, the massive amount of solar.

I got a health company we're getting ready to go with. pharmaceutical company that we're looking to work with pharmaceutical and medical supply company.

It's a lot of B2B, B2C, a bunch of different stuff. Okay. homes company that we got firing up, they have a software company, they have a fight show called Fight Circus.

Have you heard of it? No, but it's like a bunch of midgets fighting big dudes. It's crazy, but yeah.

We can do it after fight circus.



@9:31 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You got it.



@9:31 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

You got to check it out. That's crazy.



@9:34 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, that's over.



@9:35 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

That's overseas and it's coming to Vegas, so that'd be cool. That's wild. Yeah, lots of stuff going on, just hustling, know, trying to make a dollar.

These, these, you know, I'm on paper, I'm pouring cash, we got to keep going. Okay, okay.



@9:53 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Um, cool, but so the common theme with these are like, they're all high ticket. kind of products.



@10:01 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah, I take it or something that has a big future for sure. Okay.



@10:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah. So it brings value to people, helps people.



@10:11 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Okay.



@10:13 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

How do you mainly, it seems like you kind of like are, you do a bit of everything. How do you typically approach marketing for each of them?

Is it like by use case, by scenario, or do you kind of have some sort of formula built into how you approach each business?

Yeah, tell me about your approach.



@10:33 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

How? I either believe in it or I don't, right? Okay. If I don't believe it, I don't touch it.

Okay. If it's, if I believe they bring something unique to the table and want to help people, and I see massive profitability in it, yeah.

There's speed of coins that we hit that do really well. as I'm not afraid of the market, they can pretty much.



@11:03 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So, from a marketing perspective, what I'm really interested in is how do you approach the marketing for these businesses?



@11:10 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Oh, well, we look at their, well, we'll find an offer, we'll look at what they're currently doing. We'll write really solid direct response copy that hits the right emotions.



@11:23 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What is direct response copy? Direct response?



@11:27 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah. Yeah. When you, when you invoke emotion and the right emotion to make them take an action that you want them to take.



@11:35 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. I've never heard of it.



@11:37 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

psychology, right? Okay.



@11:42 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Makes sense.



@11:43 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah. there's, there's a lot of ways to do it. I mean, you can make people feel, feel happy when you need them to feel happy.

You can make them feel sad. You hit every, you hit every emotion and you, you tap into the, the million brain is the, the stem of the brain.

And you hit the. emotions that control our actions. Yep.



@12:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I just didn't know that was a word for it, direct response. Yeah.



@12:09 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Cool.



@12:10 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. you write direct response copy. Okay.



@12:14 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

We, we craft, we helped them craft their offer. We'll tweak some things and we're on a bunch of ads.

We iterate if we have to test, test, think less friction in the in automate and keep scaling.



@12:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What platforms do you use for advertising?



@12:36 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Everything. Anything that'll bring traffic that, that converts. So I don't care if it's pops, if it's tabula, it's Facebook, if it's Google, it's TikTok, Snapchat, mail, TV, radio, whatever.



@12:54 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Snail mail. Okay. in which instances do you guys choose



@13:03 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

which instances well you know it I just got back to running tablet ran it many years ago. I think it's gotten lot better, especially partnering with yahoo.

It kind of crossed the barrier of being really good if you really knew what you were doing to like being really good, even if you didn't know what you're doing.

So that's cool. Right. I can put guys on it and not have a problem. It's got some good placements with the yahoo stuff, I think.



@13:33 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Before we get into what's good, I want to understand why, in what instances, say you got a pharma company or you got your circus fighters sorry fights.

Whoever it actually is, whichever brand your company working with, why do you use to below for all of them?

Is it a specific scenario? Is it a specific audience? it a specific, like, in what instances, like you're how you're choosing, you know, meta, Google.

of you've all these platforms, in what cases would you just think, okay, to below would be good for us?



@14:06 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Well, here's the thing, here's the thing, like every offer that I run is something that there's some sort of urgent need for right now, right?

Or there's either I either sell free money, an urgent need, in desperate situations, like everything that I do that can be discoverable right now and they can, but with a massive market, it says, oh, that's me, I have that problem, but it's like a common theme, right?

So, mean, anybody in this world wants more money, anybody in this world wants better health, especially if they sit, if they were harmed in any way, anything that can make life better, you know, health, wealth, and relationships, like anything in that realm, for sure.



@14:54 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so, I'm still trying to understand in a world.



@15:00 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

cases would you use meta versus tabula or both like I want to understand the process behind advertising on the platform do all your clients do you use meta for all your clients do you like use tabula for all your clients we're just starting again so we will be yet interesting and what's the thought process behind that because native advertising is very different from like search well I mean here's the thing so yeah search is okay it does good we actually get really good CPAs on search but discovery any any kind of discovery like Facebook and taboos the Facebook's discovery tabulis discovery it's like they didn't ask for it it's in the face right taboos got a little bit more granular on where you can do placements and such and I guess you search on tabula as well you can do contextual but I would say

eight tabula and facebook are right there with each other in terms of like what it can do targeting the right people right time for sure i think you can get more scale with tabula faster and then you burn up though i think the audience burns out maybe it's the ads to fatigue i don't know i'm still learning a bit i'm going to want some more ads and see how that goes right now we i think we hit like 22 million people the last week or two and and ads died so we're going to start some new ones and see what happens okay but uh other than that okay you don't know until you test it that's that's my that's my theory it's very true you're right yeah um okay in terms of like the because what have you done so far with tabula like in the last bit not like in the past many several years but know just really



@17:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, just recently. Yeah, I ran a bunch of eating fire cases.



@17:06 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So the big fight that one of the big fires eaten fire that was over here recently, I ran a bunch of advertising for law firms or our our law firm.

Right. And then we generated a bunch of cases and now a bunch of litigation firms have cases to go after the power company for.



@17:30 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, got it. And so how was, did you use the platform? Like what was your main objective?



@17:39 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

To generate retainers signed contracts. Okay.



@17:46 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. With less of an awareness thing and more of like a bottom of the funnel trying to get sales.

We did. And you used to pull up for awareness mainly. Or more like, we're trying to get quality leads to like, what is your I want that approach?



@18:06 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Yeah, I want to act. I want action like, I don't do awareness, really. I don't really build brands. We create like, quick hitting offers and we saturate completely and then usually get out, know, these lawsuits, especially they don't last forever.

we do have a brand fight circus that that will be good for awareness, for sure. But, you know, for like these offers, they come and go, for sure.

I don't care what it is, they come and go. That's why Apple launches new products every year. That's why, you know, I'm not, I'm not at that level of Apple, obviously.

So I don't have a brand on that level to be doing a lot of awareness. I hope to get there, maybe one day, if I find the right product to do it with, but I don't, I don't.

I don't really don't have generally don't market products like that. Okay, got it.



@19:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Maybe I would, I haven't tried.



@19:09 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Okay.



@19:12 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Um, okay. So it's much more like sales action. Action, yeah.



@19:19 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Okay. Yeah, you're just going to be direct to sales, like a sales team or human sales team. Okay.



@19:25 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

don't do like a lot of econ.



@19:27 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Okay. Okay, I have, but I don't.



@19:31 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay.



@19:32 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Most of our CPAs can be in like the $1000 or $3000 range. Okay.



@19:41 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Um, in terms of the, like, why would you pick to bulla over meta in any instance? Or you're still figuring that out?

No, I think I would do both at all times.



@19:59 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Okay. yeah for sure I mean nobody has infinite traffic and new eyeballs right like yeah forever I wish they did we have to be rich right right so we saturate so you know if I saturate Facebook then I saturate Facebook and then there's tabola and then I'll saturate tabola and I'll saturate next one for that okay I'll swing back around and it's I'm constantly swinging back around making new ads and hopefully keep scaling and when offers die offers die okay um got it is there anything in particular that you like about gula that is different like it's different platform compared to Google and meta and please like what is in your mind valuable about the product and that you like specifically about it if anything yeah I mean like I think it's good traffic

I think if it had a little bit better Automation and some rules that could be done It has some rules, but it's yeah, I mean I can get into specifics I have to open up the platform because I can't exactly Okay If you want any okay, what do you mean by that though like you don't have to open up a farm But what would that help me?



@21:27 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What would it help you achieve like why did you think of rules?



@21:31 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Well, I mean It has the rules, but it's not very intuitive. I tried to set them up and it didn't work.

So I Guess I didn't really give it a good effort be honest with you. I need to learn more about the platform.

I think if The reps were a little bit more proactive and knowledgeable I Think it would help You The one thing I don't know with taboo or not.

Yeah, I mean like all the traffic platforms they literally like I take an approach where They're there to sell inventory, right and I understand that's a product so they're trying to sell it, but if Their approach to advertisers was okay Stay off these sites.

They're junk because they just keep spending and wasting money, right? And if you place here and just keep scaling you're gonna scale one and you're gonna make more money And we're gonna make more money than everybody's we have and I think the very traffic source took that approach There'd be a lot of less in the world of advertising Why do you say there's Well, there's I mean especially native and pops and other things it's plagued with

that people looking to make money on bogus traffic, right? And I think heavily does a pretty good job, and they have some tools in place like AIB and some other fraudulent tracking systems.

But, and maybe I'm not utilizing the tool completely to his full advantage, I'm still learning, but there's sites that, you know, a lot of the sites I'm noticing is they're taking a little bit here and there.

When you see a low amount of clicks or a low amount of views and a high amount of clicks on that position, that means there's some weird stuff going on in terms of fraud, right?

Typically, you'll see like on a good placement, you'll see like a two, three percent click-through rate, sometimes more, but they're not gonna be 100% click-through rate or 50% click-through rate.

And when everybody takes little piece every single day, it adds up to thousands and thousands of dollars at the end of the month, right?

for every advertiser. So if they learned how to ex-nay that, I think it would cut costs, it would make advertisers happy, and it would spend more money in that boat.



@24:10 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

You're not the first person to mention this. A lot of people have mentioned, like, bought traffic, that being like a major sore point.

Okay.



@24:25 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So they need to place their network more on who they allow it. Also, not just bots. mean, there's teams of people that literally fill out forms and make their traffic look legit, and I've cut quite a few placements that are doing that.

I can give you straight up sites that are doing.



@24:46 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. So there's some of that going on.



@24:49 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

It's not much. not But even the big sites, they'll figure out how to get a view and a click.

And then they do that every day for the next year. Share four bucks here daily times eight thousand placements.

You know, what is that? What is that? So like, you know, say say three bucks times eight thousand times 365.

That's eight point seven million dollars, if you let it go. Wow.



@25:37 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, okay. Yeah.



@25:42 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So that's, that's skinny. Yeah. But taboos make money.



@25:53 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, like not my concern right now. I mean, it is my concern, but.



@25:57 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

No, I get it.



@25:58 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

But that's, that's the name of.



@26:00 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

Advertising like that's a lot of that going on. So if they learn how to can that I think that they would crush Facebook For sure, that's that's the thing with Facebook Yeah, you got some bot traffic, but not very very very little They've filtered a lot of that crap out and we don't get a bunch of bogus leads on Facebook And you get a bunch of bogus leads on table And even even Google you have People in other countries Specifically or have team or people from here that have teams in other countries they do a lot of fraudulent stuff on Google Fake clicks and even entering in fake leads.

So you think you're getting good placements, but you're not I think that happens a lot In policing that would be a I

And two, yeah, I think they have the option to filter some of that stuff. I need to learn the tool better, for sure, and that's probably my fault, for sure.



@27:08 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Is there anything in terms of learning the tool? Is it like it just seems too complex to learn? Would you like a certain type of guidance to learn it?



@27:18 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

know, it's probably partly my fault. I need to dig and look for the guidance, but I don't think it's that hard, but some good tutorials on how-tos and best practices of what's going to make me more profitable not to have a little more profitable, for sure.

Okay, yeah. You know, how do you how do you use the rules? How do you, you know, another thing which Native in general has gotten rid of is white list and black list.

Yeah, you can use black list. But when new projects and websites pop up every day on the network, you know, generally we used to do on Native, and it worked really well, was we would have our-

white list campaign, we would have our black list campaign. We would feed, we would constantly run the black list at a certain amount of budget, and then we would take the placements that were performing and move them over the white list, and then we would continue scaling the white list, and then continually make our black list and our black list, and then we would take that black list and move the white list, or not the white list, but the white list would just show ads on the white list and placements.

And that was no longer available, and I think that that has hurt native in terms of quality, for sure.



@28:38 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

To move people from white list to black list? No, no.



@28:45 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

We would have a black list campaign that was just a lot.



@28:49 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What is the actual black list campaign?



@28:52 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

So we would have like a completely broad campaign that would just run a run of network, basically. And we feed it a bunch of money in the beginning and we would start black lifting bad placements on it.

And then we would take all the good placements and we would move them over to the white list. We know they're good, right?



@29:15 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And we're not getting the traffic.



@29:17 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

And then we would pause them on the black list campaign and let the white list campaign and the good stuff.

Okay.



@29:22 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, we'd filter out.



@29:24 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)

eventually we'd get through the whole list of every advertiser and we would know which ones are good enough. And I think we can still kind of do that, but really need a white list or a level white list.

Be great. And you know what, I was corrected. Black list and white list is not politically correct anymore. So we're going to use.

Ready. Green.



@29:50 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Oh my God. Okay. We're hoping that. All right. Okay. I'm with you. Understood.



@29:56 - Ron Smart (ROIPipe)
