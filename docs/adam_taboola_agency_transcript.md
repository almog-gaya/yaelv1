SPEAKERS

Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3

00:00
Okay, and then we have a lot of,

S

Speaker 1 00:03
we used to have a lot of, why can't I think of words the E com, e compliance, and it goes back
and forth based on the year and more, because of, just like, what happens with the industries.
So like last year, last year we had a bunch of E comm clients. And this year we have a bunch of
service based, you know, coaches,

00:28
support clients, it stuff like that. Okay,

00:30
wow. Really interesting.

S

Speaker 2 00:35
Okay, and how do you price? Is it like or, sorry, your offer? Is it like a retainer. Is it project
based? Is it like, do you get a percentage off of performance? Like, how do you kind of structure
that we

S

Speaker 1 00:47
do just a flat monthly fee retainer? We try to get them at least on a three month contract, and
then they go month to month after that. With Taboola, we actually haven't done a lot. We've
had clients that want to do it. They come to us and like, hey, keeps us for us, and do this for us.

I'm like, Yeah, sure. Hasn't been something that we like advertise that we do funny because
we're just talking about it today. Like, maybe we should throw a landing page up and say that
we do.

S

Speaker 2 01:21
Taboola, yeah, specifically Interesting. Okay, one second,

01:30
so new clients come to you and ask to use Taboola, um,

01:35
yeah, we've actually had, we have

S

Speaker 1 01:39
had like four clients now that we run app or through Taboola, and they, they've, they've asked
us to do it for them, like, we're already running Facebook ads and Google ads, and they're like,
Hey, can we run us through this for platforms for us? I'm like, yeah, we've done it before. Like,
it's not, you know, it's not that hard. We can set it up, and then we take over for them. What do

01:59
they ask for?

02:02
Um, they're looking

S

Speaker 1 02:05
for engagement, like getting more clicks to their pages and their site. So they know it's not for
in their minds, not for conversions, it's more traffic, and getting traffic moves. So they're
they're using it for a specific reason, and some of it is they're looking for investment. They're
looking for something else in particular that we're not aware of. And so they want to show that
their traffic attire to over their talking table. And so that's what they're using to bullet horn. So
it's not direct you know, they're not using it for direct sale. Basically,

S

Speaker 2 02:50

what? Okay, what's their I think, I think you might have cut out when you said this, but what's
their main reason for just having the traffic? Like, why do they want traffic?

S

Speaker 1 03:03
I think a couple of them are, they're looking for, like, investments, and so they want to show
that they have high traffic levels coming in. So they're used Bull has that, that boost of traffic?

03:16
What a hack? What

S

Speaker 2 03:21
was that? That's quite a hack. Like, really interesting. Yeah, I don't know if that's, like, legit or
not, because, like, anyone could just say they're I have a ton of volume like anyone could draw.
I don't know. Okay, cool. Are

03:39
you still with me. I mean,

S

Speaker 2 03:44
why is it cutting out? Yeah, it's kind of cutting choppy, a little bit, I don't know. Why

03:50
would you like to hop on a Google meet? Would that work for you?

03:54
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, I'm

S

Speaker 2 03:57
gonna send you a link right now, this is actually not my business email, but,

04:09
okay,

okay,

S

Speaker 2 04:12
let me just make sure I have Adam at ARC, creativeco.com, That's the one. All right, great.
Okay, I'm gonna, I just send it to you

04:25
and I'll see you in there. Okay, bye.

05:06
Hey, hey,

S

Speaker 2 05:09
okay, I'm taking some notes while we're talking. So they want to the people who are requesting
they come to you like they are new customers, and they say, We want you to advertise on
Taboola

S

Speaker 1 05:21
most of the time. They're already clients. So we're already have them in a like a Google Ad
contract or a Facebook ad contract. And so someone has told them about Taboola in some way,
shape or form, I have no idea from who, and then they'll ask us if we can run those ads for
them. And say, yeah, we can. It's not a big deal. So I'm not sure where they're hearing it from.
It's just interesting because, like I said, we've had a handful of them now, and it's not because
we've said, like, hey, we can do this for you too, or it's a service we offer. They usually come
and ask us we can run them. And we like, yeah, we've done it before. Interesting. Okay, yeah,
really random. Yeah,

06:04
that's super random. Okay, so,

S

Speaker 2 06:08
from your perspective, what is the value add of Taboola? Like, what? Where do you think it
adds value to your customers?

S

Speaker 1 06:19

S

Speaker 1 06:19
Um, I mean, definitely as a traffic source for them, right? That's what they're looking for, is
traffic.

S

Speaker 3 06:28
It's how to pick up the kids. Can you drive me? I'm gonna call on the pizza is gonna come right
now.

06:34
You can take the pizzas. Call. Thank you. Company, one,

S

Speaker 2 06:45
they're looking for traffic, is it traffic? Yeah, they're looking for traffic,

S

Speaker 1 06:49
yeah. So we have, most of the campaigns have been like, traffic campaigns. We haven't set
them up for conversions. They're not set up for like, like a CTA tracking conversion or anything
like that. So

07:07
I don't know what other

S

Speaker 1 07:11
other things that they're looking for, I would to me it's just another traffic source. What I want
to see like so the ones that we're running right now. I think it's a cheaper testing ground to see
what customers would do on the page, right? So we do a lot of testing as far as like we'll set up
hot jar and see where leads are moving and gravitating towards on landing pages. And so for
us, it seems like a cheaper alternative to just see what traffic is doing before we run a Google
ad campaign or LinkedIn ad campaign or anything like that, where we try to drive traffic to
because, like this one that we're doing right now, they created the land and landing page
without us, and we set up hot jar more because of the reason of like, let's see if this will work, if
traffic does what you want it to do. And if not, we should make some changes pretty quickly,
and we'll have data pretty quickly because of the traffic. Okay.

08:21
Okay, great.

S

Speaker 2 08:26
But is that from like, are your does your client see this as a quick like, a lot of like, it's a great
way to test, or do you see this as a great way to test? I'd say

S

Speaker 1 08:36
we see it as a great way to test. I don't think that they even give a shit. I think that they have a
budget to spend, and they're trying to just get traffic before whatever their purpose is, okay,

08:52
great for you. Yeah.

S

Speaker 2 08:57
Okay, cool. Um, so how long have you been actually using Taboola for?

S

Speaker 1 09:09
Probably, like, a year and a half now, since we started using it, as far as, like, it's not consistent,
that's for sure. It's not like we've been using it consistently over time, like this campaign we're
running currently, he only wants it running for like three weeks, but his ad spend on it is for 10
grand in those three weeks. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 09:34
okay, that's good to know. Why? Do you know why for just three weeks? Or like he's showing
investors at that he has his pitch at the end of three weeks, and that's all I need before,

S

Speaker 1 09:44
Hey, man, I wish I had $10,000 to burn in three weeks.

09:51
I really don't know.

S

Speaker 1 09:56

So this client specifically is, can. From another client that does like consulting, and he had
recommended it for the client, and they put this project together. And he said, Can you set it
up? I'll give you the assets and all of that. And I said, Yeah. And so I know nothing about the
goals for the project at all. Yeah, we just set it up.

S

Speaker 2 10:22
You're just that was it, dude, look at you balling out over here. Okay, cool.

10:29
Nice. So

S

Speaker 1 10:31
we have more clients like this. I'd be happy as a mother because

10:37
grilling me about, how

S

Speaker 1 10:39
come we didn't get any leads say, How come our sales pipelines dry?

S

Speaker 2 10:46
Was easy, amazing. Okay, okay, so, and in terms of like using Taboola, did you have like,
specific expectations with the platform, any where, where the platform kind of fell short of
those expectations.

S

Speaker 1 11:09
Not really. I think the only expectation we have is that it feeds out,

11:16
and we haven't had issues with like

S

Speaker 1 11:20

Speaker 1 11:20
so we have big issues with Google and Facebook on feed out, like pushing the ads out,
because, like, Facebook has changed their demographic shit so much over the years, and so
sometimes it's hard to narrow down a niche and put stuff in in that right demographic space
where, like, with Taboola, we really don't have that problem.

11:45
You can narrow down

S

Speaker 1 11:48
as far as like, their type of industry, type of demographic that they want the ad to be delivered
to.

11:59
Like, there's definitely enough

12:03
placements that it's going to

S

Speaker 2 12:09
What do you mean by that? Sorry, I'm not a Taboola user, and I'm not from Taboola,

S

Speaker 1 12:15
yeah. So it just how it gets served. So like when you make the ads how it gets sent out. So, like
with Google, to say Google ads, like, if there's a search volume, it doesn't get delivered. And so
with Taboola, it doesn't have that problem. Safe.

S

Speaker 2 12:41
Are you in speaking Spanish? Yeah, I live in Mexico. Oh, cool. Is this a Mexican number that you
have? No

12:49
it's my US work number. Okay,

12:59
sorry, your last name's cortex.

S

Speaker 1 13:03
I'm actually from California, but I moved out here. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 13:09
okay, so you can narrow down the industry. There's a good amount of placements that it goes
to. I'm still trying to understand exactly what this means, compared to Facebook and Google.
What are they not doing? So like, so like,

13:26
if I'm a business that is,

S

Speaker 1 13:33
I'm a law firm, and law firm is trying to reach clients ages 25, to 40 that own small businesses.
So I can narrow. Facebook has some of those demographics, those choices, but like, if I was
trying to get more specific and be like, I want them to be top 1% earners, or top 5% earners, or
anything like that. Facebook has now taken that away, and so with Taboola, some of those
demographics are there that Facebook doesn't have anymore, or that Google doesn't have
anymore.

14:16
And why is that valuable to you?

S

Speaker 1 14:19
It so I can deliver ads to the demographics that the clients want, and so it's more specific, so
we can narrow down specifically who the client's target audience is, so that they're spending
money

14:34
getting to the right people. Okay,

S

Speaker 2 14:40
and you can't do that same level of targeting on Facebook and Google is what you're
suggesting.

S

Speaker 1 14:45
It should different. It's not as it used to be great and more with Facebook, and over the years,

14:55
it's gotten less and less

14:58
specific. Isn't

15:00
that based off of their like algorithms, though,

S

Speaker 1 15:04
it's based off of caching and storing data. So like Facebook legally now can't store data that
long, and they have to reset their data storage every like week, and so it has to recollect and
recategorize all that data again, and so from a like an ad platform system like you're kind of at
the mercy of how they're able to collect that data, right? Google collects it through caching and
the sites you visit and the things that you do, and they make guesses and estimates based off
of your interaction. But because of a lot of these discrimination laws, HIPAA laws, stuff like that,
they can't collect certain things and so again, over the years, there's less and less that they can
allow us to use

16:00
because of the data that they collect is protected,

16:04
okay? Makes sense

16:07

where Ebola

S

Speaker 1 16:10
is putting ads on website placements based off of those demographics. So like, if I'm trying to
find computer people that like it and like, I'm just giving an example, right? Like, they are it
guys, they're nerds, ages 20 to 35, or 40, whatever it is. They're serving ads on like, PC wire or
whatever websites and so I, I know that Democrats, so they have a different way of selecting
those demographics compared to the way that Facebook and Google collect their data.

S

Speaker 2 16:50
Okay, so, and as a result, it's like, more relevant, like placements, correct. Okay, got it. Got you
Okay, any like, unmet expert, I'm gonna get into, like, negative parts of the platform. Maybe
you don't have any negative things to say because it's just fulfilling its purpose of traffic, but
you still are using the platform. How is it

17:16
from a any challenges, frustrations,

S

Speaker 2 17:20
anything, in terms of, you know, you wish you did this, but it's not doing this kind of thing,

S

Speaker 1 17:28
not necessarily. I mean, it served its purpose for what we needed to do right from the client
side, like, again, if there was other expectations from the clients, I might say something
different, but from what we've been having to do for them, it does what it needs to do. If we're
comparing, you know, ad platforms, it's definitely the easiest platform to set up and set ads up
for, which I know some ad people would complain about, but also like, it's not bogged down by
like, here's the thing, Facebook ads crashes all the time because they keep breaking it because
they're trying to make things better, but they're not, and they've injected AI tools into it that
have made it unstable. So when we set something up for a client on Facebook. Sometimes it
could take us three hours because the platform keeps breaking. Wow. So with like, Taboola, it
took me, like, 30 minutes, right? Once I downloaded the assets from the clients and uploaded
everything, like it was pretty quick, like there was no no bullshit. So it's pretty simple in that
way.

18:44
So, yeah, I don't have any major complaints at all,

18:49
and you're a highly technical person,

S

Speaker 1 18:51
right? Yeah, okay.

S

Speaker 2 19:01
It's very interesting that when I when I speak to different people like I enter, I literally have
these conversations all the time, the people that I speak with, the complex, the challenge in
which they encounter, the challenges in which they encounter, but the platform or no
challenges they encounter is highly related to their like, technical proficiency, because some
people are like, this is super confusing. I have no idea what I'm doing. That sometimes we're
like, it's super seamless, like, snap of a finger. Like, great platform.

S

Speaker 1 19:34
Because if you're used to like Google, like Google ads, I don't even do them because I hate
setting it up, because it's so confusing. Facebook ads, like doing a new like, we just set up a
client yesterday. They don't have a business page, they don't have anything set up, so we had
to do everything from scratch. And their system, like I said, breaks all. The time, like, there's
always errors. So what you would think is, you push a couple buttons to do setup ends up
taking two hours where the client's looking at you like, the fuck are you doing? Like, do you not
know where things are? And it's like, no, it's just Facebook being Facebook, and it doesn't want
to work. Or it's changed the way it's done it, you know, 10 times in the last month.

20:24
And honestly, with the Bulla,

S

Speaker 1 20:28
it hasn't changed in the last year. It just does what it needs to do. And that's kind of refreshing
when all these other platforms like, oh, we changed it again for you. And it's like, great, fuck
you. Now, I gotta learn something else again.

20:46
You want noisy

20:48
right now, go to sleep. Okay.

S

Speaker 2 20:57
Okay. Is there anything that you would want to bullet a change, or it's like, stay the way you
are?

S

Speaker 1 21:07
Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, again, I to me, I I'm guessing my answers would be different if we
were talking about, like, conversions and actual, like, trying to make dollars. Like, if we were to
do a comparison of, like, what which platform brings a client most money over time,

21:29
we might have a different conversation.

S

Speaker 1 21:34
And actually, one of the things that I remember was tracking was difficult, like setting up
tracking for conversions. We did try to do it one time, and just didn't work, right?

21:44
This was, like, the first account we set up,

S

Speaker 1 21:50
and I think too, is because we were looking at it from a complex way of setting up, because
we're used to that where to pull is just pretty simple. Like, just put it here, and then it'll do what
it needs to do, like, that's what, but yeah, other than that, I there's not much I can

22:08
off the top of my head. Okay.

S

Speaker 2 22:17
Okay. This is super, super helpful. Thank you so much for your time. Yeah, of course, I really
appreciate it. I hope you enjoy your pizza. Yeah, thanks. And we will like to below. We'll send

appreciate it. I hope you enjoy your pizza. Yeah, thanks. And we will like to below. We'll send
you an Amazon gift card at some point, should be by the end of the week or early next week.
Okay, nice to meet you. Adam, yes, canceled that meeting on Friday because this was my
purpose. Okay? Ciao, good, all right. Bye.
