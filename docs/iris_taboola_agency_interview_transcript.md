S

Speaker 1 03:33
amazing. So you guys, like, at one point, so you do paid advertising, and at one point you did
use Taboola, from what I see in the records here is you had spent

03:51
32,000 almost $33,000

03:54
I think it was Josiah. Was the person. I'm

S

Speaker 1 04:00
sorry what was your name? Wait, no, no, sorry. I'm confusing with someone else. Sorry, Pedro

04:08
was some Pedro Jones, yeah,

S

Speaker 1 04:12
no, stub group, no, I'm

04:18
not familiar with that name, and I've been here since 2023,

S

Speaker 1 04:21
okay, okay, so nevermind. Hang on, sorry. Joshua helmington, it was the name helming taller.

04:33
Anyways, um,

04:36
okay, just uh, let's move on from that.

S

Speaker 1 04:37
Okay, yeah, let's move on for that. Okay, so you at some point use Taboola. What did you guys
use Taboola for? Like, what was the main purpose?

S

Speaker 2 04:51
The case was that I worked on Taboola. It was to

04:58
do native ads or. Are for

S

Speaker 2 05:01

Speaker 2 05:01
clients that I can't run lead generation on because of strict,

05:08
strict questioning,

05:09
strict questioning,

S

Speaker 2 05:13
or like, like, strict guidelines on what a lead would be. So for example, I had a financial stock
clients and we used to blood to run ads to lead them to their like lead form, because they had
to be like, specific qualifications on income and things like that. Okay,

S

Speaker 1 05:39
so you had a very specific niche profile or persona? Yes, okay, okay, and was it like lead agenda
brand awareness? What were the specific outcomes that you looking for?

S

Speaker 2 05:57
So with tabular, we were running like a website traffic ad, but the main goal was to, like, lead
your generation on the website. Because, like I said, it was, there's a lot of factors that went
into what they qualified for a week for, because there was a financial based company, okay,
there's

06:17
very specific criteria. Okay, yeah, okay, um,

S

Speaker 1 06:23
and how did it turn out? How did it go?

S

Speaker 2 06:29
Um, it went in the terms of the way it worked for a little bit. But like I said, because it was super
niche, they had very little leads that qualify, just because of the income range and all of the
things that they needed for someone to be actual, to use their service. But they were able to

get a couple here or there. They had a very high cost per acquisition, so that didn't help at all.

07:00
Okay, they had a high cost per acquisition regardless,

S

Speaker 2 07:05
yeah, okay, just because they needed, like, a disposable income of at least $10,000

07:11
okay, at least Okay, got it,

S

Speaker 1 07:17
okay, and so. And then you stopped using Taboola. Why did you stop like did you sort of, did it
fulfill the goals that you were trying to achieve?

S

Speaker 2 07:27
We just decided to move it a different path for their marketing, and went down a different route
in terms of paid advertising, but we also switched our standards from using Taboola to
Outbrain. Okay,

07:43
why did you switch to out brain? There

S

Speaker 2 07:47
was just a lot of internal pieces that were moving. I wasn't necessarily a part of the
conversation of why we switched from siblings out brain at that time, as I was just a spec
number. I wasn't a leader, but they, from what I know, they just saw better results as native
ads do, they tend to overspend, and they found that there was less expenditure on the
outbreak compared to Taboola. And just like those were some of the factors that I knew about. I
wasn't behind the entire

08:21
Okay. Got it? Um,

S

Speaker 1 08:25
okay, so it had to base, mostly it was like spend in performance, like how much money you
were spending to acquire customers, and that just the outcomes, I suppose, is what I'm
hearing.

S

Speaker 2 08:38
Yeah, they were testing. They were running tests between the two of them for similar
campaigns, and just found that outbreak was performing better at the time. Okay.

08:52
It was just, I believe there's often user friendly, okay, um,

S

Speaker 1 08:58
anything in terms of like what you were expecting. I don't know if you can recall this, to be
honest, like, try your best, but any thing in terms of like, what you were expecting would
happen from Taboola that you just didn't get.

S

Speaker 2 09:16
Oh gosh, it was, it was quite some time ago. This was probably back in December of 2023 not
really that I could recall. I mean, we knew what we were walking into when we were using
dated advertisements for that one client. But it was just, it was, it was harder to track stupid
law was very it was harder to use an upbringing one harder to track what in terms of like,

09:52
it was we,

S

Speaker 2 09:55
it's so hard to just because you so long ago and try to remember specific details. Really sorry.
And it was, no, you're fine. It was just that offering really was more user friendly in terms of
finding everything that I needed to find. Felt like on Taboola, I had to hunt things down, or
really use a lot of the help articles to find specifically what I was looking for when it came to
terms of invoices or how to track conversions and things like that. Whereas, without being very
simplistic,

10:27
daily, step by step, as I was doing it, okay,

10:33
so it was like setting up the ads and

S

Speaker 1 10:38
okay, like setting it up and tracking it and just making every making sure everything was was
seamless. Was that was not straightforward with Taboola and it was more straightforward
without brain. Yeah, okay, um, okay. And you're, you guys saw lower cost of acquisition with
without brain,

S

Speaker 2 11:02
yes. And it was also with the native ads, typically, we do see that like, there is an over
expenditure of, like 20% with out there, and we saw less over spending than we did with
Taboola.

S

Speaker 1 11:17
Taboola, sorry, you were saying there was a 20% overspend.

S

Speaker 2 11:23
Yeah, so it's like, whenever we put a budget on there, it would still overspend, which we figured
it's not just taboo with, like most native ads, but and Taboola tended to spend over way more
than outbreak there with the same budget limitations. Okay?

S

Speaker 1 11:47
Okay, um, and the main reason for why you would choose out brain like in, what is this is, do
you use out brain? Why do you use native advertising?

S

Speaker 2 12:01
Um, we use native advertising when it's in the best interest of the Orient to not do social media
ads directly. So in the social media department, we run like Facebook ads, Instagram, Pinterest,
LinkedIn, we name it next door. But when we use outbreak, it's just because we believe that it
would be better to do direct traffic, especially with regulations on those social media platforms.

S

Speaker 1 12:32
What? What can you explain to me in like, really basic terms, in what instances would you want
direct traffic of regulations like, what? What are the in what? What are the common themes
where these instances would occur? Is it a certain type of client, a certain type of goal, a
certain type of market to reach, like, what? What is better for a need?

S

Speaker 2 12:58
So it would be the market to reach. So like I mentioned that one client that did financial stock
trading, you're not going to find them typically on like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, rarely
online parents, especially because of all of the lead qualifiers they needed. Using native
advertising would be much better for their audience, because those type of people are
constantly doing research on the internet, okay? And those are, those are people who are more
willing to click on something while they're researching, rather than clicking on an ad on social
media. Okay, got it?

S

Speaker 1 13:37
Okay. This is super helpful. Last piece and we're done, is any specific? Is there any change you
would recommend to Bula makes that would actually provide you with more value,

13:52
and like lead you to consider using the platform?

S

Speaker 2 14:01
I would say, making it just more user friendly in terms of being able to be able to set up the ad
and the invoicing, the invoicing can be as a team leader, I have a protocol that we put our app
on, but the invoicing for people is very inconsistent.

14:24
Sorry, the invoicing was inconsistent.

S

Speaker 2 14:27
Yeah, it's just the way that invoicing worked. It wasn't it wasn't always like posted by the first of
the month when expenses reports were due, it would take a lot of time, and downloading the
invoices were incredibly difficult.

S

Speaker 1 14:46
Okay, so just where the invoices and Taboola you mean?

S

Speaker 2 14:51
Yeah, yeah, trying to get the invoices for my expense reports from Taboola were necessarily a
pain. Because even though. It spent for the month. It wouldn't restart. It would just
continuously keep going for the previous month into the next month. So, like, for example, I
had a charge for the month of, like, November that went into December. What

15:18
do you mean? It went into December? Like,

S

Speaker 2 15:23
like the ad stopped at the end of November, and it didn't really charge like on the first of the
month. Instead, it charged on like the 11th of the month.

15:33
Okay, got it?

S

Speaker 1 15:41
Okay. So you just wanted to be consistent, like, charge you on the first of every month, as
opposed to

S

Speaker 2 15:48
talk to me, Yeah, or like, the like, the end of the month, or kind of, like, when an ad campaign
stops just because it's like, for expense reports, it makes it it makes it messy, essentially,
especially for like, client billing and stuff. Okay, makes

S

Speaker 1 16:07
a lot of sense. Anything else, user friendliness of setting up the ads, making the invoicing more
consistent.

16:16
Anything else,

Anything else,

S

Speaker 2 16:19
um, not that I can think of. Like I said, I haven't worked with Taboola since December of 2023.
Was the last time I used it. Okay, so that's pretty much everything that I can that I can really
recall at the moment. Okay,

S

Speaker 1 16:31
this is so helpful. Thank you so much. What's your email? So I can send you an Amazon gift

S

Speaker 2 16:38
