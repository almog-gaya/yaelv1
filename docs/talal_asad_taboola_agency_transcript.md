@0:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

into this. Okay. So you are, tell me about your agency. you an agency? Wait, you hear me? Wait, you're on mute.

Sorry.



@0:23 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yes, we're on the agency. We're focused only on CPG products like physical CPG products. Our bread and butter work is on Amazon, but like for Tabula and stuff, we do create and we have created native ads back to consumers websites.

yeah, we work with like, you know, 15 different companies right now, but we onboarded one with Tabula for a few months and it just didn't really work out.

Okay.



@0:53 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

So you try to do what you want to try, Tabula.



@0:59 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Um, the customer. From base of our client is skews pretty old. It's like 75 plus. And, you know, I've been wanting to do Yahoo native ads, which I know that you are now like the sole provider of or the major provider of.

And so an MSN ads as well. And so that's why I figured like these advertorial type native ads, especially ones that have like lots of education around them or things that like can be dressed up as a the article would be really, really strong for our user base, which it is like they love our blogs and our posts.

But for some reason, we just couldn't get them really working on table. Okay.



@1:45 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Back to just your business. Okay. you are an agency. What kind of agency are you? Like an e-commerce agency.

Okay, e-commerce like advertising agency. would say everything e-commerce. Okay, so let's say content, everything. Okay, amazing. Okay, and they're physical products, food as well, like that kind of thing.

so what kind of platforms, what is your promise to your customers? Like what is your, or are you doing everything from brand awareness to lead gen to sales?

what is your, like what are you promising them, I guess?



@2:37 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yes, I mean sale, every, I mean you live and die by sales, right? Brand awareness and all of that stuff are very secondary because, yeah, I mean most of it is crap.

So for us it's very much bottom of the funnel stuff, especially when it comes down to, at the end of the day, like it's all about performance marketing, so we're a performance marketing agency.



@3:00 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, so less about brand awareness. Yes.



@3:03 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Okay.



@3:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I love that, by the way, like it's like cut through the and it's just like deliver outcomes. Okay, and what kind of campaigns had you been running previously?

Like what platform would you use for clients?



@3:25 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah, so like we're adept at, you know, I'm gonna say we're experts at Amazon ads. So that's its own thing.

And then we do Google ads, Bing as well.



@3:37 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. And do you, you know, what's your offering? How do you like kind of take a percentage of sales?

Do you, is it just a flat retainer model management? what is your business model?



@3:52 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah, it's like a retainer plus percent of some, I mean, it really depends on client to client, how we structure the deal.

But usually the mix would be a retainer or a fee for service that's kind of flat or it would be flat plus percent of spend you know with with their targets in mind.

Okay. We have some we have some that we do with percent of growth as well. Okay.



@4:19 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

so okay so your experts and Amazon ads, Google ads, position meta being your position yourself as a performance marketing agency so you're really there to deliver outcomes um sales and you had you had a customer whose customer base of clients is 75 and a half or is it a couple of customers?



@4:41 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Uh we have two customers that are very skewed older like two of their customers right so like the end user of their of their product is 75.

they're their customer base okay and did they suggest to you that to do tubula or did that was on me?

Yeah that was me. sort of sell, even if it was at a terrible, terrible ROAS, as long as like there was some way to optimize it, but we weren't seeing anything come through.

So you weren't seeing any leads at all? No, none. We're seeing clicks, but then we record every single click, and like a lot of those clicks were one click does nothing on the site.

So it seemed like there was a lot of bot traffic.



@6:26 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, I'm going to make note this just while you're talking. Yeah, okay, that makes a lot of sense and something I've heard before.

Okay, so no leads. right.



@6:47 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Correct, no leads. think we had maybe one add to cart, uh, zero conversions, um, and zero sales.



@6:56 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And how, what were you expecting? But like, what were you expecting to happen?



@7:03 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

So I was expecting for us to convert at least to start at a one-to-one clip, like a one-to-one ROAS.

Just enough to say, hey, there are people on the site that are interested. The secondary metric that we were looking at was, are they at least playing around on the site, right?

Maybe they just don't like the offering, but we didn't really see much in terms of time on site numbers from the typical referral, or just in general, like playing around looking at products.

Everyone was just kind of like stopping at whatever landing page was being presented to them.



@7:40 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. By the way, what is a one-to-one ROAS?



@7:47 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Just like a dollar spent dollar sale, so it's not profitable, but at least it shows that there is something there.



@7:55 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay, and how much time, like testing and time, do you anticipate? You've got on these high quality of quality domains.

Which quality don't look what kind of domains are you referring to?



@9:05 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

I would consider like the major news ones like Yahoo homepage Yahoo News MSN News I know you guys have Apple we can get to that level yet, but once you're on those ones where if I'm like, you know I see your I see your ads all the time By the way, I'm not I'm external.

when I say yours, then I'm meaning I know Like when I see tabula ads, there are some that are like very like that that definitely like are working, right?

There's they're embedded right into a news article and a lot of times the Native news article that's there or the non ad I would just call them like the real news articles that are there You know lots of times do you talk about the sort of it's situations that my clients is product solve So this one in particular was like urinary incontinence So it's like you can always talk about like the top five things

when have urinary incontinence, how to care, give for someone who has urinary incontinence, like things like that. Unfortunately, like even there, I think that the biggest, I mean, the most clear sort of, you know, outside of sales, the most clear way that you can see that like traffic that is coming in is quite quality, is that like, at least they're reading the article, and we use Lucky Orange to track people's like, time on the site, scroll ability and stuff, and like, people weren't even scrolling, people were like, people were just clicking in and then they were done, which means that's a very high evidence of bot traffic.



@10:40 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Or maybe not evidence, but indication. Okay. How much learning about Togula did you do prior to using the platform?

I would say a pretty, pretty decent event.



@10:54 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

We went through like the university or whatever it's called, like the learnings. It was me and a team member.

So, We did learn quite a lot of like what converts while we rest that we read the best practices guide and things like that So we then reformatted our Articles and our stuff to follow those best practice guides.

So I would definitely say that we spent The few hours that's required to do. I mean, this isn't it's not the hardest I want to work on honestly It was pretty straightforward There was a little bit of hiccuping at the beginning with like getting the tags all set up And I had some issues with my like account getting blocked a few times But once that all rolled out, it wasn't I mean it wasn't too difficult to figure out how to set up a campaign And we had a really good account manager kind of walk us through it as well.

So yeah, we spent a few hours Okay, I had an account manager as well.



@11:43 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yes Okay And how much do you end up spending I can actually see this oh yeah $1,500 $2,000 you ever take okay you spent $650

Yeah, wow, that's it on that one.



@12:02 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah, so yeah, that makes sense.



@12:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And what you like willing to spend on it, if we saw any sort of life from it, like, you know, we would have definitely give it.



@12:13 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

We wanted to give it a $5,000 test, but when you're already like almost, you know, 20 15% of your budget gone and nothing's going on, there's really not much more optimization.

I could see that, you know, before, before creating more tests. What would have been great is to bullish it to probably just given us like $1,000 credit to test it out, you know, that I mean, I feel that would have been a really nice gesture.

And that's like, all of the other ad platforms get between $500 and $1,000 of credit to test the platform.

Which other platforms do that? Google, Meta used to, you can still do it through different programs, but Google always gives about 500 for 500 in spend or 1000 for 1000 in spend.

And then Amazon It's about $1,000 worth of different types of spends as well.



@13:05 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. No, it did. Um, and those ones were all seeing way positive on our, on our, on our, uh, thing, on us.

Okay. Um. Okay. In terms of the setup, you mentioned everything kind of seems straightforward. Were there any kind of like walls you were running into or any frustrations or any, you know, issues that you had setting things up that could have been more seamless?

Yeah.



@13:48 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

tag management part, um, the like the documentation there is pretty general. And even if it's all set up and whatnot, it's like, there's one thing that you would need to know about tag management.

and a juror that it did not really talk about. And then on the screen, it says everything is fine when it's not.

So that part was a little frustrating, but I have to say that. Can you me sorry, is there anything else?

Oh, yeah, no, that's the main one. There's one more that we could talk about later. Which one, which thing?



@14:21 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

I'm going to go over about. Sure.



@14:23 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

The other one is the account getting blocked or not serving. And so it took like we had a block, not the block removed, then nothing was serving for about a week or two.

And support was, no, everything's fine. And then when I escalated to the account manager, she then escalated and seemed like there was just some sort of like funky tech thing that they had to turn on.



@14:45 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

OK, so wait, the account is getting blocked. Then the block was removed. said nothing was serving, what did you say?

Yeah, nothing was serving.



@14:55 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Oh, OK.



@14:57 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

does that mean?



@14:58 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

means ads weren't being delivered. Okay.



@15:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

We're okay. Tag management. What do you mean by that?



@15:12 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

So in order to track the success of your stuff, you have to like set up tags or pixels onto your site that are tableau-based.

That's usually there's like, but we chose the Google Tag Manager route, which is one of the cleaner routes of doing it.

And, you know, if you're going through the system, it says like, you test the tags and stuff like that and gives you a little green check marks, like everything's good.

We were getting the everything's good, but like, I wasn't seeing any of the pixels, what's called firing, meaning like the pixels showing that they've been hit.

And so there was like a little bit more back and forth with the tech team on it before it started working.

And there was one thing that we had to do that wasn't in the documentation. I can't remember exactly what it is, but we did that and that.

Okay.



@16:07 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

What do you have to figure that out yourself? What did the team tell you do that? We figured it out ourselves.

That's annoying.



@16:14 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah.



@16:17 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. just to kind of specify why you're like one like this is my last question here, I think.

Thanks. You, there was a very specific reason for why you thought about Chibula. Could you kind of recap that for me?



@16:52 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

thought that native ads would be a really good avenue for high quality traffic. a convert. Especially with our customer base.



@17:04 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

With this specific customer base of this niche, is that what you mean? Correct. And what exactly was the niche?

know 75 and up, but what was the niche again?



@17:19 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Um, incontinence, reusable incontinence, underwear.



@17:22 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, that is very specific.



@17:24 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah, I mean it's a huge, it's a huge market. There's a lot of old people and their bladders don't hold.

So we provide probably the best reusable product on the market. We're the oldest. Okay.



@17:46 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

And you thought this would be better than meta or google?



@17:50 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

I thought it could perform as an additional channel to meta or google. I did not think it was going to be better than google.

Okay.



@18:09 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

If you're using Google, why don't you try it as an additional channel?



@18:14 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

New sources of customer base, new sources of income. Like Google is very search oriented, so people would have to be in the market and search for it, whereas this one, know, people are just sitting there digesting their daily news or sitting there and searching and then seeing something topical pop up as an article.

So the whole native ad strategy seemed like it would be a really good fit to this product type. Okay.



@18:44 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Amazing. Okay. This is really helpful. Super insightful. I'm glad. Yeah. And if there's anything else that you feel like, you know, you didn't express here, you feel free to just mess up.

do me or shoot me an email. If you've everything went using Tabula again, yeah, I think there's a lot of great feedback here.



@19:08 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

Yeah, I mean, I definitely think if there's one thing that you could suggest to Tabula would be new platforms really should offering new platform credits because the cost to Tabula is so minimal to serve these ads.

Like the cost per clicks are 40 to 70 cents. There's one dollar maximum. That means the cost to acquire those thousand impressions is like what, 12, 20 cents, their margin.

So it should be super, super cheap for them to offer up credits and get people more familiarized with the system.

Unless the opposite is it fails more than it doesn't fail and so they don't want people to know it fails before they bounce from the system.



@19:52 - Yael Morris (Decode Insights)

Yeah, when I was speaking with the marketing, so I work with marketing. That is What I do I ask them I'm like if someone's spending $500 Should they be getting leads?



@20:06 - Talal Asad (Brand Together)

They're like they should be getting leads at $300 and I'm like there's some gap here something wrong here So like that needs to be fixed I personally like so I've been working in ad tech for 15 years and like I was working on like the ad tech side and The amount of bot traffic that exists is really really really high And I think tabula uses a double verify exclusion and I think that that really helped us get into more of the Higher quality sites when that exclusion black list was put on but I think tabula needs to do a better job of of building out bot traffic All right, noted Thank you.
